## Feature X60 - Input Source

Feature x60 (change input source) is one of the most useful DDC features.
It's also among the most problematic.

- On some monitors, the feature value can be read of set from any input.  On others, getvcp and setvcp 
work only on the currently active monitor.



Verify the feature values.  Some monitors do not use the standard values.
