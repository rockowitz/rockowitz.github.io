Their work is summarized on this wiki page . To facilitate sending commands to these monitors, option --i2c-source-addr was added. Prebuilt packages for several Linux distributions and machine architectures can be found in the usual locations . Prior announcements can be found here . Introduction ddcutil is a Linux program for managing monitor settings, such as brightness, color levels, and input source. Generally speaking, any setting that can be changed by pressing buttons on the monitor can be modified by ddcutil . ddcutil primarily uses DDC/CI (Display Data Channel Command Interface) to communicate with monitors implementing MCCS (Monitor Control Command Set) over I 2 C. Normally, the video driver for the monitor exposes the I 2 C channel as devices named /dev/i2c-n. Alternatively, there is support for monitors (such as Eizo ColorEdge displays) that implement MCCS using a USB connection. See USB Connected Monitors . A particular use case for ddcutil , and the one that inspired its development, is as part of color profile management. Monitor calibration is relative to the monitor color settings currently in effect, e.g. red gain. ddcutil allows color related settings to be saved at the time a monitor is calibrated, and then restored when the calibration is applied. Restrictions: ddcutil does not support laptop displays, which are controlled using a special API, not I 2 C. Generally speaking, ddcutil can be built in a virtual machine, but will not run in a VM. This is because the virtual video drivers do not implement I 2 C. However, if the VM is connected to a separate video card and is running a non-virtualized driver for the card in passthru mode, then ddcutil will work. Nvidia's proprietary video driver may require special configuration. See Special Nvidia Driver Settings . Reading and writing Table type features is implemented but untested.

DDC/CI is layered on top of that protocol, describing particular sequences of bytes that are communicated between a master device (the host computer) and a slave device (a monitor) at address x37 on an I 2 C bus. By analogy, DDC is as a subclass of superclass I 2 C, that is DDC obeys the rules of I 2 C, but is more specific. For example, only certain byte sequences are legal. SMBUS is another protocol based on I 2 C. ddcutil reads from and writes to the userspace /dev/i2c * devices which present a file system like abstraction of an I 2 C bus. It leaves the bit-banging to the video device drivers, e.g. amdgpu, nouveau. One source of confusion in DDC documentation is the specification of slave adddresses on the I 2 C bus. Sometimes you'll see the DDC address documented as x37, other times as the pair x6e/x6f. Leaving aside the implementation of 10 bit I 2 C bus addresses (uncommon), I 2 C slave addresses are encoded in a single byte. The high order 7 bits are used for the address per se. The low order bit is 0 for a write operation, 1 for a read operation. Much of the VESA documenation regards the entire 8 bit value as an address, which means address x37 becomes the pair x6e/x6f. Similarly, the 7 bit address for the EDID is x50; regarded as an 8 bit address, the EDID address becomes xA0/xA1. ddcutil specifies I 2 C slave addresses in 7 bit form, as do utilities such as i2cdetect , i2cget , and i2cset .

New header files: File Name Contents ddcutil_macros.h Macros to specify the ddcutil version at compile time ddcutil_status_codes.h Status codes defined by ddcutil Multithreading There is rudiementary support for multi-threaded use of the API. Considerations: It is safe to perform simultaneous operations on separate displays (using distinct display handles) on separate threads. Multiple simultaneous DDC operations on the same display will have unpredictable results. Do not open multiple handles for the same display. The ddcutil API prevents opening multiple handles for devices with the same DDCA_IO_Path, which blocks the most common case. However, it is conceivable that the same monitor might be connected in multiple ways (e.g. with both a DDC and USB connection), with multiple cards, or even from separate computers. In this case it is the application's or even user's responsibility to ensure that conflict does not occur. The following settings are now thread specific: whether setvcp verification is enabled ( ddca_enable_verify() , ddca_is_verify_enabled() ) output redirection ( ddca_set_fout() , etc.) output level ( ddca_set_output_level() , ddca_get_output_level() ) Presently, multi-threaded operation is best managed in the application. The C++ Qt based GUI currently under development does the following: - Calls ddca_get_display_info_list() to enumerate the displays - Opens the display (i.e. creates a DDCA_Display_Handle ) - Maintains a queue of requests - Calls the ddcutil API for each request, and updates the GUI accordingly Library Build Information No changes.

MCCS Version Identification To date, the API has had two different ways to specify the Monitor Control Command Set (MCCS) version: - DDCA_MCCS_Version_Spec , a pair of 8 bit unsigned integers. - DDCA_MCCS_Version_Id , an enum of valid MCCS versions. Going forward, the API will use DDCA_MCCS_Version_Spec . Existing functions using DDCA_MCCS_Version_Id are retained, but are marked as deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Once the deprecated functions are removed, there will likely be some simplification of the remaining function names.

Miscellaneous changes: - Bitfield DDCA_Version_Feature_Flags now has bit DDCA_NC_COMPLEX , indicating a VCP code (designated by MCCS as Non-Continuous) that uses certain values as an NC feature and uses the remaining range for continyous adjustment. An example of such a feature is VCP code x62 (Audio Speaker Volume) as defined in MCCS versions 3.0 and 2.2, where value x00 is defined as \"Fixed (default level)\", value xFF is \"Mute\", and values x01..xFE provide a continuous range for volume adjustment.

General changes: - The names of report functions that display internal data structures for debugging, as opposed to reports designed to be shown to users, now begin with \"ddca_dbgrpt_\" instead of \"ddca_report_\". - Enum values DDCA_V10 etc. are now DDCA_MCCS_V10 etc. (but note that the use of DDCA_MCCS_Version_Id is deprecated in favor of DDCA_MCCS_Version_Spec ) - Names of parameters that specify the address at which a pointer is to be returned now generally end in \"_loc\". Specific changes not listed elsewhere: Old Name New Name DDCA_IO_DEVI2C DDCA_IO_I2C Naming patterns: - Functions that always return the same value generally do not include \" _get_ \" in their names, e.g. ddca_ddcutil_version() , ddca_max_max_tries() - In the case of \"overloaded\" functions, \" _by_ \" is usually used to distinguish variants, e.g. ddca_get_feature_metadata_by_vspec() , ddca_get_feature_metadata_by_dref() , get_feature_metadata_by_display() - However, in the case where there the result depends on a single input value from which the result is extracted, \" _from_ \" is used, e.g. ddca_mmk_from_dref() , ddca_mmk_from_dh() Get and Set VCP Feature Values DDCA_Any_Vcp_Value vs DDCA_Non_Table_Vcp_Value The API provides functions for getting, setting, and otherwise processing VCP values in 3 forms, using the type specific DDCA_Non_Table_Vcp_Value or DDCA_Table_Vcp_Value or the more general DDCA_Any_Vcp_Value . The first form is simpler to use, and does not entail the allocation of arbitrarily size buffers. As a practical matter, while the MCCS spec defines Table type features, they have not been observed on any monitors. Supporting Table type features in a UI adds complexity. API users will probably want to use the simpler DDCA_Non_Table_Vcp_Value functions. The following tables summarize the structs and API functions for getting and setting VCP feature values.

How best to deal with them? Multiple design principles apply here. Unfortunately, they conflict: - Libraries should not crash - Programming errors should cause immediate and spectacular failure - Client programs should not have to test for return codes that reflect programming errors. This clutters the code. Java addresses this conundrum through the use of RuntimeExceptions, such as NullPointerException and IllegalArgumentException, which need not be caught, or can be caught at the top level of a program. Unfortunately, C doesn't provide such an elegant solution. Until now, many precondition tests have been done using assert() statements. This is not a long term solution, since assert()s can be disabled when programs are built for production. Other precondition failures have resulted in a return code of DDCRC_ARG . As a first step, the assert() statements and other precondition tests have been unified with a common set of macros. This at least provides more consistent behavior, and will facilitate future changes. For now, a precondition failure results in a message to stderr and a return code of DDCRC_ARG . In the future, this may change to a message followed by library abort. Or the behavior may be controlled by the client using an API call to select the desired behavior. Comments on this design issue are invited. Notes on Freeing Resources ddca_free_ functions fall into two groups, those that specify client side data structures and are referenced by a normal pointer, and those that specify internal library data structures and are referenced by an opaque pointer. Those that specify client side data structures are essentially convenience functions, relieving the client programmer of the details of freeing what may be a complex data structure. These functions always return void. If passed a NULL pointer, they do nothing. Functions that free client data structures ddca_free_error_detail() ddca_free_display_info_list() ddca_free_parsed_capabilities() ddca_free_table_vcp_value() ddca_free_any_vcp_value() ddca_free_feature_metadata() Functions that free internal library data structures take an opaque pointer as an argument. These functions return a DDCA_Status . They return DDCRC_ARG if the pointer is invalid. If the pointer is NULL, the function does nothing and DDCRC_OK is returned. Depending on the function, additional status codes are possible. Whether or not memory is actually freed is a hidden implementation detail, as some opaque pointers reference persistent internal data structures. Functions that free internal library data structures ddca_free_display_identifier() ddca_close_display() Additional Notes: If a function that creates a resource (e.g. ddca_create_busno_display_identifier() ) returns other than DDCRC_OK (0), then the resource is not created and need not be freed. In general, the order in which the ddca_free_ functions are called does not matter. The ddca_free_ functions are not idempotent. Attempting to free an already freed opaque resource will likely return DDCA_ARG , but may result in a segfault. Attempting to free an already freed client side resource will also likely result in a segfault.

Functions that free internal library data structures ddca_free_display_identifier() ddca_close_display() Additional Notes: If a function that creates a resource (e.g. ddca_create_busno_display_identifier() ) returns other than DDCRC_OK (0), then the resource is not created and need not be freed. In general, the order in which the ddca_free_ functions are called does not matter. The ddca_free_ functions are not idempotent. Attempting to free an already freed opaque resource will likely return DDCA_ARG , but may result in a segfault.

This string describes, among other things, the VCP Features that the monitor supports and, for non-continuous features where appropriate, the allowed values. Unfortunately, the capabilities string is unreliable. Therefore ddcutil simply presents the string. It does not use the capabilities string when formulating commands and interpeting responses. The capabilities string is unreliable for several reasons: The response to the DDC capabilities request may simply be incorrect. For example, the capabilities response from the HP LP2480zx monitor does not list VCP feature code x10 (brightness) as supported. However, feature code x10 is in fact supported. The only way to know for sure if a monitor implememts a VCP feature code is to try it. A DDC capabilities request requires multiple I2C exchanges, making it both slow and unreliable. Because of its complexity, it is particularly vulnerable to I2C errors. On monitors with paticularly poor I2C implementations it sometimes fails because the maximum number of I2C retries is exceeded. There is no capabilities request defined in the programming interface for USB connected monitors. ddcutil simulates a capabilities response by looking at what USB HID reports exist for feature codes. Note however, that ddcui does make use of the the capabilities string. By default the capabilities command displays the capabilities string in parsed form.

This string describes, among other things, the VCP Features that the monitor supports and, for non-continuous features where appropriate, the allowed values. Unfortunately, the capabilities string is unreliable. Therefore ddcutil simply presents the string. It does not use the capabilities string when formulating commands and interpeting responses. The capabilities string is unreliable for several reasons: The response to the DDC capabilities request may simply be incorrect. For example, the capabilities response from the HP LP2480zx monitor does not list VCP feature code x10 (brightness) as supported. However, feature code x10 is in fact supported. The only way to know for sure if a monitor implememts a VCP feature code is to try it. A DDC capabilities request requires multiple I2C exchanges, making it both slow and unreliable. Because of its complexity, it is particularly vulnerable to I2C errors. On monitors with paticularly poor I2C implementations it sometimes fails because the maximum number of I2C retries is exceeded. There is no capabilities request defined in the programming interface for USB connected monitors. ddcutil simulates a capabilities response by looking at what USB HID reports exist for feature codes. Note however, that ddcui does make use of the the capabilities string. By default the capabilities command displays the capabilities string in parsed form.","title":"Command capabilities"},{"location":"command_capabilities/#option-terse","text":"Display the unparsed capabilities string.","title":"Option: --terse"},{"location":"command_capabilities/#option-verbose","text":"Display both the unparsed string and its parsed form.","title":"Option: --verbose"},{"location":"command_detail/","text":"Command Detail Primary Commands detect getvcp setvcp vcpinfo dumpvcp & loadvcp scs Secondary Commands environment usbenvironment probe interrogate chkusbmon Options Display Selection Options Feature Selection Options Performance Other","title":"Command Detail"},{"location":"command_detail/#command-detail","text":"Primary Commands detect getvcp setvcp vcpinfo dumpvcp & loadvcp scs Secondary Commands environment usbenvironment probe interrogate chkusbmon Options Display Selection Options Feature Selection Options Performance Other","title":"Command Detail"},{"location":"command_detect/","text":"Command detect Syntax: detect <options> Scans the system for displays supporting the Monitor Control Command Set (MCCS), most commonly using DDC/CI but alternatively using USB for communication.

Release 0.5.3 07 February 2024 Release 0.5.3 requires libddcutil from ddcutil 2.1.3 or later. Release 0.5.2 27 January 2024 Release 0.5.2 contains some minor cleanup. There are no significant changes. Release 0.5.0 16 January 2024 ddcui release 0.5.0 requires libddcutil.so.5.1 from ddcutil 2.1.0 or later. Versions of ddcui prior to 0.4.0 will not build with libddcutil.so.5 from ddcutil-2.0.0 or later. Display Status Detection When libddcutil detects connection or disconnection of a display, ddcui puts up a dialog box reporting the change and indicating that the user needs to redetect displays using Action->Redetect Displays. Miscellaneous Changes If multiple \"options\" lines are found in a segment of configuration file ddcuirc, their contents are combined into a single value. Building ddcui If CMakeLists.txt option ASAN is specified, cmake compiles ddcui using options needed for ASAN and links the executable with libasan. Release 0.4.2 27 September 2023 ddcui release 0.4.0 requires libddcutil.so.5 from ddcutil 2.0.0 or later. Versions of ddcui prior to 0.4.0 will not build with libddcutil.so.5 from ddcutil-2.0.0 or later. Passing options to ddcui and libddcutil ddcui now uses a separate configuration file, $HOME/.config/ddcutil/ddcuirc, instead of combining the [global] and [ddcui] sections of ddcutil configuration file $HOME/.config/ddcutil/ddcutilrc. Added options: --noconfig , --disable-config-file . Do not obtain options from configuration file $HOME/.config/ddcutil/ddcuirc. --libopts \"options\" . Passes an option string to the shared library. This string is appended to the libddcutil option string obtained from the ddcui configuration file. Several ddcui command line options existed solely to pass options to the shared library. These can now be passed using option --libopts or the configuration file and have been eliminated: --nousb --trace --trcfunc --trcfile Menu item Actions->Debug Locks reports locking the libddcutil as a debugging aid. Logging --syslog <log level> controls what messages are written to the system log by ddcui and libddcutil . Valid levels are NEVER , ERROR , WARNING , NOTICE , INFO , and DEBUG . The default is NOTICE . Building ddcui : CMakeLists.txt recognizes option DDCUTIL_PROJECT_DIR, which specifies the ddcutil project directory in which libddcutil is built. Using this option avoids having to install libddcutil.so in a system directory in order for ddcui to use it. e.g. cmake -D DDCUTIL_PROJECT_DIR=/my/ddcutil/project/dir Release 0.3.0 05 August 2022 General User Interface Changes CTL-Q terminates ddcui (does not apply within dialog boxes) Errors opening /dev/i2c and /dev/usb/hiddev devices are reported using a message box instead of being written to the terminal. These errors typically reflect lack of permissions (Linux error EACCESS). Optionally requiring the control key to be pressed when changing feature values now applies to all changes, not just those made using sliders. (The option is set using command line option --require-control-key or the UI Options dialog box.). The tab key was not jumping to the OK and Cancel buttons in option dialogs. Feature Value Handling For simple NC values, do not include the SH field in validation when changing a value. It has been observed that there exist monitors (e.g. Dell U4320) for which the high order byte of feature x60 (Input Source) can be non-zero. EBUSY Errors As of libddcutil release 1.3.0, the shared library has been modified to avoid the code path in driver i2c-dev that can produce EBUSY errors. Options --force-slave-address and --disable-force-slave-address , introduced in Release 0.2.1, are deprecated and no longer have any effect. For details see Device Busy (EBUSY) Errors in the release notes for ddcutil 1.3.0. Release 0.2.2 22 February 2022 Critical Bug Fix Fix an erroneous assert() statement that could cause a compilation failure or segfault in the handling of features X62 (Speaker Volume). Release 0.2.1 02 February 2022 Handling EBUSY Errors New command line option --force-slave-address enables ddcui to take control of DDC communication with a display from a conflicting program, notably display driver ddcci. For details, see Option: --force-slave-address and Device Busy Errors in the main ddcutil documentation. CMakeLists.txt Cleanup The minimum required version of CMake is set to 3.10. The CMakeLists.txt script is known to work in Ubuntu 18.04, which has CMake 13.10. It may work for earlier CMake versions; the cmake_minimum_required() statement can be edited to allow execution, Most messages from the script, issued using the message() statement. are defined to have message level VERBOSE. By default, these are not shown, reducing output clutter. Using cmake command line option --log-level=verbose will cause them to be shown. However, message level verbose did not exist prior to release 3.15. In that case the messages are unconditionally issued. If ccache is installed, cmake command line option --use-cache controls whether ccache is used to reduce build time. The default is --use-cache=yes . Better support for CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE. The default is -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG . Option Removed: Use Latest Feature Values Option \"Use Latest Feature Values\" in the NC Feature Values dialog, and corresponding command line option --use-latest-nc-values have been removed. This option told ddcui to use the NC values for the most recent MCCS specification, as opposed to the MCCS version that the monitor reports. This option was hard to explain and convoluted to implement. The User Defined Features facility makes it unnecessary, since that facility can be used to define the NC values for a monitor feature. Miscellaneous Disable selecting the Capabilities and Feature views for a monitor if it doesn't support DDC/CI, or the capabilities string cannot be read. Disable all view selection if no monitor is detected. Release 0.2.0 25 November 2021 While far from complete, this release should be suitable for general use. The code base has been extensively reworked. This section summarizes user visible changes since release 0.1.2. ddcui 0.2.0 requires at least libddcutil.so.4.1.0 from ddcutil package 1.2.0 or later. Enhanced Feature Representation In MCCS 2.2 and 3.0, some features have both a set of special values and a continuous range. These include x62 (Audio Volume), x63 (Audio Balance) , x87 (Audio Tebble), X91 (Audio Bass), and x93 (Audio Balance). The widget for these features has both a slider/spinbox for the continuous range and a combo-box for the special values. Non-Continuous Feature Values There are three interrelated mechanisms for addressing unexpected values for a simple Non-Continuous feature. The monitor may report a feature value that is not listed in the capabilities string or the Monitor Control Command Set. In this situation the value is still listed in the combo box even if another value is subsequently selected. When presenting simple Non-Continuous feature, ddcui uses the values/name table specified for the monitor's MCCS version. Sometimes monitors use feature values defined in a later version. The Use latest MCCS values checkbox in the NC Feature Values dialog specifies that the NC value table for the highest possible MCCS version be used. This can also be specified by command line option --force-latest-nc-value-names . Supply a User Defined Feature definition. See User Defined Features . Redetect Monitors For situations where a display is attached or detached, Menubar option Actions->Redetect Monitors can be used to redetect displays. The plan is for this to happen automatically in a future release. Miscellaneous User Interface Changes The Other Options dialog has been renamed to NC Feature Values . Help screen content has been revised and extended. General user interface cleanup Desktop Integration Install ddcui.desktop in /usr/share/applications. Install icons in /usr/share/icons/hicolor. An icon is also installed in /usr/share/pixmaps as Gnome Classic only looks in the latter directory. Install ddcui.appdata.xml in /usr/share/metainfo. Use icon \"video-display\" from Oxygen theme as it already exists under an open source license. Configuration File Configuration file, typically $HOME/.config/ddcutil/ddcutilrc, is shared with ddcutil and libddcutil . Options can specified for the ddcui command line, and also for passing directly to the shared library. See page Configuration File . Invocation Several command line options that were simply passed to libddcutil have been removed from the command line, as they can now be be specified instead in the [libddcutil section of configuration file ddcutilrc . These include --udf , --no-udf , --nousb , --maxtries , -- sleep-multiplier , --sleep-less , --less-sleep , --no-less-sleep , --dynamic-sleep-adjustment . Command line option --help does not report development related options. Use --help-development or --help-all to see them. Building ddcui qmake is no longer supported. Use cmake. Release 0.1.2 29 June 2020 Bug fixes: The combo boxes for simple Non-Continuous values appeared empty instead of showing the current value and list of allowed values. Release 0.1.1 24 June 2020 Command Line Options Several command line options have been added. See Command Line Options User Defined (aka Custom) Feature Set Custom feature sets enable the user to specify exactly which features are to be shown in the Features view. Feature Slection Dialog changes: Radio button Custom has been added as an alternative to MCCS , Capabilities , etc. for feature set selection. When Custom is clicked, an edit box enables entry of the feature codes to be included. These are entered as two character hex values, with or without a leading \"x' or trailing \"h\". The values are separated by commas and/or blanks. Command line option --custom-feature-set specifies the custom feature set from the command line.

If more than one monitor is attached, the desired monitor can be specified using the following options: Option Note --display <display number> --bus <i2c bus number> alt: -b <i2c bus number> --usb <usb bus number>.<usb device number> --hiddev <usb hiddev device number> --edid <256 character hex string> --mfg <mfg code> 3 character mfg id from EDID --model <model name> model name from EDID --sn <serial number> ASCII serial number from EDID Any combination of manufacturer code, model name and serial number can be used together to identify a monitor. The first monitor to satisfy all the specified criteria is selected.

Occasionally the converse is true. This section describes how DDC, or more precisely I 2 C, is communicated over DisplayPort, and may prove helpful when analyzing DDC communication problems. I 2 C is a simple serial protocol that uses 2 signaling lines, referred to as SCL and SDA, sometimes referred to as DDC clock and DDC data, along with their associated grounds. These are pins 12/15 on a HD15 VGA connector, 6/7 on a DVI connector, and 15/16 on a HDMI connector. DVI and HDMI use the same protocol, TMDS (Transition Minimized Differential Signaling) for transmitting video information. While more recent versions of HDMI have additional capabilities, e.g. Ethernet and CEC, in terms of video and DDC communication DVI and HDMI are equivalent, except for bandwidth. It's possible to connect a DVI output on a host to a HDMI input on a monitor, or vice-versa, using a simple DVI<->HDMI cable. (High bandwidth communication may require dual-link DVI and associated conversions, but that is tangential to the present discussion.) DisplayPort, on ther other hand, uses its own packetized protocol for video. It also has a secondary Auxilliary (AUX) channel (and pins) for non-video communication. DisplayPort does not have the I 2 C SCL/SDA pins. Instead, the logical I 2 C signals are converted at each end into messages on the AUX channel. Put another way, DDC is implemented using the AUX channel, but the AUX channel itself is not DDC. The \"multiplexing\" of I 2 C over the AUX channel is transparent to all but the lowest level of I 2 C software at each end. It is possible to connect the DisplayPort output on a host to a DVI or HDMI input on a monitor using an \"active\", or sometimes a \"passive\", adapter. Most active adapters connect a DisplayPort output on the host to a DVI or HDMI input on the monitor. An active adapter converts the DisplayPort video signal to the TMDS video signal used by DVI or HDMI. It also converts the I 2 C signals on the AUX channel to and from the physical SDA and SCL signals on the DVI/HDMI connector. To the host, it appears that it is communicating with a DisplayPort input on the monitor. To the monitor it appears that it is communicating with a HDMI or DVI output on the host. There are active adapters that convert a DVI/HDMI output on the host to a DisplayPort input on the monitor. These adapters are uncommon, and are much more expensive.

If the video adapter implements Display Port Dual Mode, also known as DP++, then it is possible to use a \"passive adapter\" between the DisplayPort output on the host and the HDMI/DVI input on the monitor. When the host detects that its DisplayPort output is connected to a HDMI/DVI monitor input instead of a DisplayPort input, it shifts to \"dual mode\", treating its DisplayPort connector as if it were a weird DVI/HDMI connector. It uses TMDS for the video signal, and uses the AUX channel pins as simple SDA/SCL pins. A \"passive\" adapter simply routes wires appropriately, and adjusts voltage levels.

Check the following: Is DDC/CI enabled in the monitor's On Screen Display? Is driver i2c-dev loaded? Does the current user have permission to access the I2C bus associated with the monitor? Command ddcutil environment will analyze your system environment and make suggestions. See enviroment Command ddcutil doesn't work on my laptop. Laptop displays do not support DDC/CI. But recent laptops use Embedded Display Port (eDP) panels which have an I2C interface. Why doesn't ddcutil work? The I2C connection on eDP panels implements slave address x50, which allows programs to read the EDID in the expected way. However, it does not implement slave address x37, i.e. it does not support DDC/CI. If eDP panels did implement DDC/CI, ddcutil would support it. For each I2C bus that could possibly be associated with a monitor, as part of display detection ddcutil attempts to read the EDID at slave address x50. If successful, it then attempts to communicate on slave address x37. If that fails, and display detection is occurring in the context of ddcutil detect --verbose , ddcutil then looks for a possible reason, and checks to see if the display is a laptop. If so, it then reports that laptops to not support DDC/CI. ddcutil is slow. Typically, ddcutil spends 90% of its elapsed time in waits mandated by the DDC/CI protocol. Two options can have a big impact on performance: Option --bus . If the /dev/i2c bus number of the monitor is given, ddcutil skips the initial phase of searching the /dev/i2c devices for monitors. Note that if this option is specified, no other monitor selection option such as --display should be specified. Option --sleep-multiplier . This option adjusts the length of time ddcutil spends in DDC/CI mandated waits. For example, if the DDC/CI protocol specifies a 40 ms wait between the time a command is sent to the monitor and the time a reply is read, and --sleep-multiplier .2 is given, ddcutil will only wait (.2 x 40 ms) = 8 ms. Some monitors have been found to communicate successfully with --sleep-multiplier values as low as .1. On the other hand, some monitors with poor DDC/CI implementations perform better if the sleep time is increased by using a value greater than 1. ddcutil can't communicate with a monitor when it's plugged into a docking station. ddcutil does work when the monitor is plugged directly into the laptop. The problem affects DisplayPort, DVI, and HDMI connectors on the dock. This is a problem with newer docking stations that implement DisplayPort Multi Stream Transport. Until kernel release 5.11, the drm driver layer did not implement I2C writes. For the gory details, see this thread on the Intel-gfx developers list. I'm using Nvidia's proprietary driver. ddcutil doesn't seem to be be working. Symptoms include \"DDC communication failed\" on ddcutil detect , and lots of \"Maximum retries exceeded\" errors on command ddcutil getvcp known . You may need the Nvidia secret handshake. See Special Nvidia Driver Settings . The capabilities command reports the MCCS (aka VCP) version, but elsewhere ddcutil says the version is unknown. DDC/CI has two ways to get the the MCCS version: As part of the capabilities string returned in response to a DDC Capabilities Request. As the response to a VCP Feature Request for feature xDF (VCP Version). Sometimes they disagree. Command ddcutil capabilities reports the response to the DDC Capabilities Request. However, ddcutil regards this output as purely informational. (See capabilities command ) ddcutil therefore relies on VCP feature code xDF to determine the VCP version. (For USB connected monitors, it queries HID usage x00800004.) It is possible that feature code xDF is unsupported, even though the capabilities response specifies a version. The output of the capabilities command is incorrect. For example, a Dell P2210 monitor has VGA, DVI, and DisplayPort inputs, but capabilities only reports: Feature: 60 (Input Source) Values (unparsed): 01 03 Values ( parsed): 01: VGA-1 03: DVI-1 The capabilities string reported by a monitor is often incorrect. While the ddcutil capabilities command parses and reports the string, this is solely informational. The only way to know for sure if a monitor supports a VCP Feature Code is by testing using the getvcp and setvcp commands. The following command will attempt to read all VCP codes that ddcutil understands, other than those that are write-only: ddcutil getvcp known To attempt to read all possible VCP codes, whether understood by ddcutil or not, except for those that are known to be write-only: ddcutil getvcp scan To see all the values defined for a non-continuous (NC) feature code, i.e. one with discrete values, use the vcpinfo command with the --verbose option. For example, to see all the values defined in the Monitor Control Command Specification for VCP feature x60 (Input Source): # ddcutil vcpinfo 60 --verbose VCP code 60: Input Source Selects active video source MCCS versions: 2.0, 2.1, 3.0, 2.2 MCCS specification groups: Miscellaneous ddcutil feature subsets: Attributes (v2.0): Read Write, Non-Continuous (simple) Attributes (v2.1): Read Write, Non-Continuous (simple) Attributes (v3.0): Read Write, Table (normal) Attributes (v2.2): Read Write, Non-Continuous (simple) Simple NC values: 0x01: VGA-1 0x02: VGA-2 0x03: DVI-1 0x04: DVI-2 0x05: Composite video 1 0x06: Composite video 2 0x07: S-Video-1 0x08: S-Video-2 0x09: Tuner-1 0x0a: Tuner-2 0x0b: Tuner-3 0x0c: Component video (YPrPb/YCrCb) 1 0x0d: Component video (YPrPb/YCrCb) 2 0x0e: Component video (YPrPb/YCrCb) 3 0x0f: DisplayPort-1 0x10: DisplayPort-2 0x11: HDMI-1 0x12: HDMI-2 In practice, any given monitor will implement only a few of the NC values, and some monitors will implement undocumented values. The only way to know for sure is by testing. Why do commands capabilities and vcpinfo report different information? vcpinfo and capabilities get their feature value lists from different places. vcpinfo reports the values given in the Mointor Control Command Set spec (MCCS). Its information is not monitor-specific. Option --mccs allows for selection of a specific MCCS version; if not given the most recent MCCS version in which the feature is defined, typically 2.2, is used. capabilities reports the values shown on the capabilities string returned by the monitor. Normally, the interpretation of the value is that listed in the MCCS spec (reflecting the MCCS version of the monitor, as given in the capabilities string or, if that is not given, by querying feature xDF). If the value is unknown to the MCCS spec, \"Unrecognized value\" is reported. However, if the feature is defined in a user defined feature file for the monitor, the values reported for that feature are those in the UDF file, not those in the capabilities string, and the interpretation is that in the UDF file. (The uninterpreted string reported by capabilities is not modified by the UDF file; it is exactly that returned by the monitor.) For example, many newer monitors have a USB-C input. No USB-C value for feature x60 (Input Source) is defined in any version of the MCCS spec, which is rather dated. Some manufacturers use x0b for its value, other manufacturers use a different value, and there's even no guarantee that a given manufacturer uses the same value on all its monitors. The only way for ddcutil to know about a USB-C value is for it to be defined it in a monitor-specific user defined features file. As a further comment, the capabilities string can be unreliable. For example, the capabilities string reported by a Samsung U32H750 is \"60( 11 12 0F)\". The interpretation of those values, per the MCCS spec, is HDMI-1, HDMI-2, and DisplayPort-1. However those are not the actual values used by the monitor. The monitor recognizes x05 as HDMI-1 and x06 as HDMI-2. A user defined features file for the monitor, SAM_U32H75x-3586.mccs, could contain: MFG_ID SAM MODEL U32H75x PRODUCT_CODE 3586 MCCS_VERSION 2.1 FEATURE_CODE 60 Input Source ATTRS NC RW VALUE x05 HDMI-1 VALUE x06 HDMI-2 VALUE x0f DisplayPort ddcutil detect --verbose reports that both I2C address x50 (EDID) and x37 (DDC) are responsive, but DDC communication fails. There can be any number of reasons for this situation. Check that DDC/CI communication is enabled in the monitor's on-screen display? It has been observed in the case of a Tegra video card using the nouveau driver. See also the discussions of duplicate entries for a DisplayPort monitor , and of failures with newer docking stations . The same DisplayPort connected monitor appears twice in the output of ddcutil detect . Sometimes the same DisplayPort connected monitor is detected at 2 different I2C bus numbers. ddcutil detect reads the EDID at on both buses, but typically DDC communication succeeds on only 1 bus. ddcutil attempts to filter out the invalid bus, and refers to it as a \"phantom\" display. The invalid bus is a result of the implementation of the DisplayPort multistream facility. You can ignore the invalid entry. For more information, freedesktop.org i915 issue 3605 - Same MST display appears as 2 /dev/i2c devices contains an explanation of the complexity of MST topology The detect command reports different EDIDs depending on how the monitor is connected to the video card. Strange as it may seem at first, a monitor can have more than one EDID. The EDID for a VGA connection will have a different video input definition (byte x14) than that for a digital connection. The VGA version of the EDID will have timing information. The detect command reports that I2C bus address x30 (EDID block number) is inactive. EDID version 1.4 allows for addtional 128 byte EDID blocks. I2C bus address x30 specifies which block to read. These blocks generally contain extended timing information. ddcutil is interested only in the contents of the first EDID block. The check of bus address x30 is purely informational. setvcp does not change the feature value Several Iilyama monitor models require that command scs (Save Current Settings) be issued immediately after a feature value is set. setvcp must be invoked with the --noverify option, followed immediately by scs . Some monitors disable changing features such as brightness, contrast, and color when in Cinema or other special mode. Changing to a custom mode may enable these features. The monitor supports Dynamic Contrast Range (DCR). setvcp for feature x10 (brightness) does not change the value At least some monitors with Dynamic Contrast Range (DCR) disable feature x10 (brightness) and possibly other features when DCR is enabled. This has been reported with both Lenovo and Benq monitors. The new value for feature x10 is different from the value specified on setvcp It is common for the new value of a Continuous feature to be off by 1 from the specified value. This appears to be the result of integer to floating point to integer conversion in the monitor. At least one monitor (Dell 2407wfp) does not allow setting brightness less than 30. setvcp values in the range 0..50 are mapped to to 30..50. ddcutil hangs on Radeon RX 5xxx and 6xxx cards (Navi and Navi2 GPU) There have been multiple reports of ddcutil command failures on Radeon cards with the Navi and Navi2 GPUs (RX 5xxx and RX 6xxx cards). In some cases ddcutil hangs. (See for example issues Stop poking AMDGPU SMU I2C #194 , Screen freeze when changing brightness #223 ).. The SMU related hang should have been fixed as of kernel 5.14.4. ddcutil has had a workaround since release 1.1.0. In other cases, the monitor's EDID is simply not detected. If your kernel version is 5.14.4 or later, I suggest you file a bug report at the amd driver issue list . Include: - drm output - the kernel log file (/var/log/kernel on Ubuntu) - output of the following commands $ sudo ps -aux | grep ddcutil $ sudo awk ' {print FILENAME \": \" $0 } ' /sys/bus/i2c/devices/*/name KDE Plasma 6 ddcutil commands fail after upgrade to version 2.0 and KDE Plasma 6 ddcutil 2.0 added a cross-instance locking facility. The problem addressed was random failures when multiple ddcutil or libddcutil instances clobber each other's DDC transactions. Internally, ddcutil uses what are called display handles to represent /dev/i2c devices that have been opened at the OS level. Proper use of the API is, for each DDC transaction, to open a display, creating a display handle, perform the transaction, and then close it. This sounds expensive, but in fact the time spent opening and closing is negligible compared to the time spent performing the I2C operations of a DDC transaction. When the cross-instance locking facility is enabled, and a display is opened creating display handle, ddcutil calls flock() on the underlying /dev/i2c device and holds the flock until the handle is closed. Unfortunately, at startup PowerDevil creates a display handle for each /dev/i2c device and never closes it. So the flock's are never released, blocking other ddcutil instances. Cross-instance locking can be disabled using option --disable-cross-instance-locks. This option can be specified on the ddcutil command line, or in configuration file $HOME/.config/ddcutil/ddcutilrc. The latter is the only way to control libddcutil, which is used by PowerDevil. For a description of configuration files, see https://www.ddcutil.com/config_file. Powerdevil crashes repeatedly with ddcutil 2.1.0 ddcutil 2.1.0 API introduced an initialization function, ddca2_init() , into the libddcutil API to give the client, e.g. PowerDevil, finer control of libddcutil's initialization. If the initialization function is not called, then default settings are used. There was a bug in default initialization that caused PowerDevil to crash repeatedly. This was fixed in ddcutil 2.1.2. Also, PowerDevil was changed to explicitly call the initialization function, thereby avoiding the bug. With two different fixes for same problem, it may not be obvious what change made PowerDevil work again. Does ddcutil work in containers? User Nikolay Dandanov has reported success running ddcutil in a Docker container: I defined a new Arch Linux image for Docker using the following simple Dockerfile : FROM archlinux:latest RUN pacman --noconfirm -Syu && \\ pacman --noconfirm -S ddcutil && \\ rm -rf ~/.cache/* I saved this to a file named Dockerfile and built a Docker image using ~~~docker build -t ddcutil:v0.0.1~~~.

For example, to see all the values defined in the Monitor Control Command Specification for VCP feature x60 (Input Source): # ddcutil vcpinfo 60 --verbose VCP code 60: Input Source Selects active video source MCCS versions: 2.0, 2.1, 3.0, 2.2 MCCS specification groups: Miscellaneous ddcutil feature subsets: Attributes (v2.0): Read Write, Non-Continuous (simple) Attributes (v2.1): Read Write, Non-Continuous (simple) Attributes (v3.0): Read Write, Table (normal) Attributes (v2.2): Read Write, Non-Continuous (simple) Simple NC values: 0x01: VGA-1 0x02: VGA-2 0x03: DVI-1 0x04: DVI-2 0x05: Composite video 1 0x06: Composite video 2 0x07: S-Video-1 0x08: S-Video-2 0x09: Tuner-1 0x0a: Tuner-2 0x0b: Tuner-3 0x0c: Component video (YPrPb/YCrCb) 1 0x0d: Component video (YPrPb/YCrCb) 2 0x0e: Component video (YPrPb/YCrCb) 3 0x0f: DisplayPort-1 0x10: DisplayPort-2 0x11: HDMI-1 0x12: HDMI-2 In practice, any given monitor will implement only a few of the NC values, and some monitors will implement undocumented values.

Its information is not monitor-specific. Option --mccs allows for selection of a specific MCCS version; if not given the most recent MCCS version in which the feature is defined, typically 2.2, is used. capabilities reports the values shown on the capabilities string returned by the monitor. Normally, the interpretation of the value is that listed in the MCCS spec (reflecting the MCCS version of the monitor, as given in the capabilities string or, if that is not given, by querying feature xDF). If the value is unknown to the MCCS spec, \"Unrecognized value\" is reported. However, if the feature is defined in a user defined feature file for the monitor, the values reported for that feature are those in the UDF file, not those in the capabilities string, and the interpretation is that in the UDF file. (The uninterpreted string reported by capabilities is not modified by the UDF file; it is exactly that returned by the monitor.) For example, many newer monitors have a USB-C input. No USB-C value for feature x60 (Input Source) is defined in any version of the MCCS spec, which is rather dated. Some manufacturers use x0b for its value, other manufacturers use a different value, and there's even no guarantee that a given manufacturer uses the same value on all its monitors. The only way for ddcutil to know about a USB-C value is for it to be defined it in a monitor-specific user defined features file. As a further comment, the capabilities string can be unreliable. For example, the capabilities string reported by a Samsung U32H750 is \"60( 11 12 0F)\". The interpretation of those values, per the MCCS spec, is HDMI-1, HDMI-2, and DisplayPort-1. However those are not the actual values used by the monitor. The monitor recognizes x05 as HDMI-1 and x06 as HDMI-2.

The problem addressed was random failures when multiple ddcutil or libddcutil instances clobber each other's DDC transactions. Internally, ddcutil uses what are called display handles to represent /dev/i2c devices that have been opened at the OS level. Proper use of the API is, for each DDC transaction, to open a display, creating a display handle, perform the transaction, and then close it. This sounds expensive, but in fact the time spent opening and closing is negligible compared to the time spent performing the I2C operations of a DDC transaction. When the cross-instance locking facility is enabled, and a display is opened creating display handle, ddcutil calls flock() on the underlying /dev/i2c device and holds the flock until the handle is closed. Unfortunately, at startup PowerDevil creates a display handle for each /dev/i2c device and never closes it. So the flock's are never released, blocking other ddcutil instances. Cross-instance locking can be disabled using option --disable-cross-instance-locks. This option can be specified on the ddcutil command line, or in configuration file $HOME/.config/ddcutil/ddcutilrc.

The first uses ioctl(). The second, simpler, interface hides the ioctl() calls behind a traditional file io based interface, using functions write() and read(). Normally, ddcutil uses the ioctl() interface. Unfortunately, when the ioctl() interface is used with older versions of the Nvidia proprietary video driver, the Nvidia driver rejects calls from i2c-dev. When this error is detected, ddcutil switches to using the file io interface. This option forces use of the file io interface, avoiding the need for recovery. For details about how this problem was diagnosed, see ddcutil issue #341 . Option: --force-slave-address When the i2c-dev file io interface is used, occasionally communication cannot be established because driver i2c-dev has marked the I 2 C bus as being in use by another program (error EBUSY ). This option allows ddcutil to take control of the bus, potentially impacting the other program. (Internally, ddcutil uses ioctl(I2C_SLAVE_FORCE) instead of ioctl(I2C_SLAVE).) This option has no effect in the normal case where the i2c-dev ioctl() interface is used. Option: --edid-read-size 128|256 Sometimes a display's EDID cannot be read on I 2 C slave address x50. As a result, ddcutil does not report the existence of a display connected to the /dev/i2c device. ddcutil attempts to work around this by trying to read the EDID multiple times with both 128 and 256 block sizes. Depending on the monitor, usually one or the other will work, but sometimes neither do. Option --edid-read-size , introduced in release 1.0.1, can force the block size to 128 or 256. Option: --i2c-source-address <hex address> Recent LG monitors allow for splitting the display screen between multiple input sources. Instead of the (relatively) simple VCP feature x60 (Input Source), they use an undocumented protocol, to control how the screen is split and which input source is shown where. Thanks to a community effort, particularly by user Max Thomas (Github handle shinyquagmire23 ), some of this protocol has been reverse engineered. It entails using an alternative I 2 C source address, x50 instead of x51, in the I 2 C packet. Option --i2c-source-addr provides a way to use this alternative address in DDC communication.

Unfortunately, when the ioctl() interface is used with older versions of the Nvidia proprietary video driver, the Nvidia driver rejects calls from i2c-dev. When this error is detected, ddcutil switches to using the file io interface. This option forces use of the file io interface, avoiding the need for recovery.

For ddcui changes, see ddcui Release Notes 2.2.0 05 Dec 2024 Release 2.2.0 contains some major enhancements, particularly for display change detection, numerous small changes, and a large number of bug fixes. DisplayLink DisplayLink devices, using the evince driver, are supported. Raspberry Pi Fix display not found and DDC communication failure on Raspberry Pi. Do not rely on sysfs attributes that do not exist for ARM devices. Resolves github issues 403 , 413 . Miscellaneous changes to allow for building on raspbian. User Defined Features Add feature type XNC (Extended Non-Continous). This is like simple NC , but the SH byte is also reported. Provides a solution to the primary problem raised in github issue 403 . Note that this feature type was created for use in user defined feature definitions; there are no features of this type defined in the Monitor Control Command Set specification. Allow SNC (Simple Non-Continuous) as alternative name for NC . Report user defined features as part of parsed capabilities. Commands recognizing user defined features now fail if there's an error loading a user defined feature file. These are capabilities , setvcp , dumpvcp , and probe . Fix error msg when nothing follows VALUE in user defined feature file. When processing a user defined feature file, recognize any whitespace character (e.g. tab), not just space.

Provide a clearer message if slave address x37 is inactive: \"Monitor does not support DDC\" instead of generic \"DDC_commnication failed\" If option --verbose is in effect, emit an additional message to check the monitor's OSD. Report the Monitor Model Id in the --verbose output. Command setvcp Do not report \"Interpretation may not be accurate.\" when the VCP version cannot be determined. This message is irrelevant for setvcp , which does not interpret feature values. Partially addresses github issue 454 . Commands interrogate and environment --verbose Force settings --disable-cross-instance-locking , --disable-dynamic-sleep . Forced settings apply to environment --verbose as well as interrogate When probing DRM, recognize bus types DRM_BUS_PLATFORM, DRM_BUS_HOST1X, report as \"platform\", \"host1x\". Simple getvcp test was not reporting the bytes of the response packet. If no device with class x03 was found, the user's home directory was dumped. Addresses github issue 413 . Remove \"-i\" option on get-edid command. Does not exist on some versions. Udev rules /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/60-ddcutil-i2c-rules: Also give logged on user r/w access to /dev/dri/cardN, needed to allow logged on user to probe connectors using DRM. Do not install /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/60-ddcutil-usb.rules, delete it if previously installed. Addresses github issues 405 , 428 , 437 .

Fixes github issue 407 . Convert CRLF line endings in source to LF. Rework laptop detection. A non-laptop display can have an eDP connector. This is an i915 video driver bug that will not be fixed. See freedesktop.org issue [DRM connector for external monitor has name card1-eDP-1] (https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/i915/kernel/-/issues/10389) Building ddcutil As an aid to development, the build date and time are normally embedded in the ddcutil and libddcutil executables. This is reported using command ddcutil --version --verbose\". libddcutil reports this to the system log. If reproducible builds are required, use configure option --disable-build-timestamp **. configure options --enable-x11 / --disable-x11 are restored. The default is --enable-x11 . The X11 API continues to be used to test for DPMS sleep mode. Changes for portability: Use printf() formats %jd and %zd to portably print variables of type ssize_t, and time_t, so as to build unchanged on architectures such as armel, armhf. Avoid compiler warning possible depending on compiler configuration when a switch() construct is used. Replaced with if/else if/else. Resolves issue #458. Compile using option -Wformat-security . Issue 458 . Shared Library Shared library libddcutil is backwardly compatible with the one in ddcutil 2.1.0. The SONAME is unchanged as libddcutil.so.5. The released library file is libddcutil.so.5.2.0. Display Change Reporting Detection of display connection and disconnection has been extensively reworked. Detecting and reporting sleep mode has proven very problematic. libddcutil no longer watches for and reports changes to DPMS state. However, if an API function is called to perform an operation that requires communiation with a display that is asleep, status DDCRC_DPMS_ASLEEP is returned. ddca_start_watch_displays() has been modifed accordingly in a backwards compatible way. The only event class that can be enabled is DDCA_EVENT_CLASS_DISPLAY_DETECTION. . - DDCA_EVENT_CLASS_ALL is effectively the same as DDCA_EVENT_CLASS_DISPLAY_CONNECTION. It is an error if either DDCA_EVENT_CLASS_DPMS or DDCA_EVENT_CLASS_NONE are specified. Performance is improved using UDEV and /sys to watch for changes and to get the EDID if possible. Connection of Multi-Stream Transport (MST) hub devices is detected if the driver/device combination supports it. Not all drivers do. Display change detection is unreliable with the nvidia proprietary driver. The nvidia driver does not use /sys in the same way as amdgpu, i915, nouveau and other drm enabled drivers that are part of the Linux kernel. Depending on driver version the phase of the moon, the /sys file system does not reflect display changes and UDEV events are not generated. In that case no display changes are reported. There is an alternate, much less efficient algorithm that does not rely on UDEV and /sys that can be used for nvidia. It instead attempts to read an EDID from every (plausible) /dev/i2c device in a polling loop. Users with all but the most powerful machines will likely find it much too resource consumptive. It is enabled by option --watch-mode poll . The following named options affect display change detection. ---watch-mode udev|poll . the default is UDEV . --enable/disable-try-get-edid-from-sysfs (default --enable-try-get-edid-from-sysfs ) This may or may not improve performance at the expense of reliability. Some monitors behave in ways that make KDE PowerDevil unstable. See, for example, ddcutil github issue 466 , github issue 470 and KDE bug 495746 . Specific monitor models can be excluded from display change detection using option --disable-ddc , which takes a Monitor Model Id, e.g. SAM-U32H75x-3587, as an argument. The monitor model id can be found in the output of command ddcutil detect --verbose , and is the same monitor model id that is used in the name of a user defined features file. -- Typically, this option will be added to the [libddcutil] section of configuration file ddcutilrc. It can also be included in the options string passed in the opts argument to ddca_init2() . Display change detection can be completely disabled using libddcutil only option --disable-watch-displays . This blocks ddca_start_watch_displays() from starting the thread that watches for display changes. Workaround for issue 470 . Unlike the use of KDE Plasma environment variable POWERDEVIL_NO_DDCUTIL=1, this disables display change detection while leaving other libddcutil services available. In addition to the named option, several utility options currently affect display change detection. Some of these will become named options when ddcutil version 2.2.0 is released, others will be removed once testing is finished. --f17 do not use sysfs connector_id (default is to use it) --f18 always report UDEV events --f20 do not try to avoid rechecking DDC responsiveness when a display is reconnected (default is to remember prior checks) --f21 always treat sysfs as unreliable for reporting display changes --f22 never treat sysfs as unreliable for reporting display changes --i6 watch loop sleep multiplier (multiply default watch loop settings) --i7 extra stabilization milliseconds after apparent disconnection --i8 explicit udev poll loop milliseconds (takes precedence over --i6) --i9 explicit non-udev poll loop milllisec (takes precedence over --i6) As the requirements become clearer, it is expected that the API will add functionality currently specified only as libddcutil options. Other Shared Library Changes Quiesce operation: - Quiesce the API during ddca_redetect_displays() . Operations that access display state are not permitted, and return DDCRC_QUIESCED . Status codes: - Most functions that specify a DDCA_Display_Ref now return status code DDCRC_DISCONNECTED if the display reference is no longer valid. - Status code DDCRC_INVALID_CONFIG_FILE has been renamed to more general DDCRC_CONFIG_ERROR, and is used instead of DDCRC_BAD_DATA for User Defined Feature File errors. DDCRC_INVALID_CONFIG_FILE is a valid alias. System log: - Write build date and time to system log when starting libddcutil . - Rework libdccutil output to avoid duplicate msgs in the system log when all terminal output is directed to the log, as with KDE Plasma. - Include thread id in messages written to syslog. Miscellaneous: - Use mutexes to control access to corruptable data structures, such as the table of open monitors. - Recover instead of abort when more than one non-removed display refs exist for the same display. - Enum value DDCA_STATS_API is added to enum DDCA_Stats_Type, for reporting API specific stats. - ddca_start_watch_displays() : Fixed segfault that occured with driver nvidia when checking if all video adapters implement drm. github issue 390 . - During initial display reference validation, an otherwise valid display reference may be for a removed display. Avoid a segfault in this case. Addresses github issue 418 . - Ignore phantom displays when searching for a display reference. Addresses github issue 412 . - ddca_get_display_refs() and ddca_get_display_info_list2() always return 0, even if an error occured when examining a particular monitor. Addresses github issue 417 - Errors that occur opening individual displays or reading their EDIDs are are still reported using ddca_get_error_detail() . In addition, error messages are written to the terminal and, depending on the current syslog level, to the system log. - It is useful to create a string representation of a display reference even if it is no longer valid.

When ddcutil adheres to the spec, it typically spends approximately 90% of its elapsed time sleeping. Many monitors respond properly with much shorter waits. On the other hand, there are monitors that require longer waits to avoid DDC/CI errors. There are two ways to adjust wait times: explicitly using option --sleep-multiplier , and automatically using dynamic sleep adjustment. Option: --sleep-multiplier Option --sleep-multiplier applies a multiplication factor to the DDC/CI specified sleep times. The multiplication factor is a floating point number. For example, --sleep-multiplier .5 causes 40 ms waits to become 20 ms, and --sleep-multiplier 4 causes 40 ms waits to beome 160 ms. Note that ddcutil may automatically increase wait times when peforming retries. Option --sleep-multiplier applies to the inital wait time. Option --sleep-multiplier can significantly speed up ddcutil execution - some monitors have been seen to operate properly with a sleep-multiplier as low as .1, Decreasing the sleep multiplier increases the chance of DDC/CI communication failures, requiring retries. Option ---stats tries can help in picking an optimal value. Options: --enable-dynamic-sleep , --disable-dynamic-sleep The default is --enable-dynamic-sleep . The dynamic sleep algorithm automatically increases the sleep-multiplier factor (as needed) and decrease the sleep multiplier factor (insofar as possible). Data is maintained across program executions in file $HOME/.cache/ddcutil/stats. Option --enable-dynamic-sleep or one of its variants such as --dsa turn it on (the default). Option --disable-dynamic-sleep turns it off. If both --sleep-multiplier and --dsa are specified, existing statistics are discarded and the sleep algorithm restarts calculation with the specified sleep-multiplier value. Therefore --sleep-multiplier should generally not be used along with --dsa . By default, existing statistics are retained even when dynamic sleep is disabled. To discard cached sleep statistics at the start of program execution, use option --discard-cache dsa (alt. --discard-cache sleep ). Retry Management Option: --maxtries I2C is an inherently unreliable protocol, requiring retry management. There are 3 kinds of operations in which retry is possible: Write-only operation. A request packet is written to the monitor with no subsequent read. Used only to set a VCP feature value, and to execute command scs (Save Current Settings). Write-read operation. A request packet is written to the monitor, followed by a reading a response packet. Most DDC protocol operations are of this type. Multi-part operation. This is a \"meta\" operation, consisting of multiple write-read or write-only operations. Used to query monitor capabilities, and for querying and setting Table type VCP features. By default, the maximum number of tries for each operation type is: write-only operation: 4 write-read operation: 10 multi-part operation: 8 (Note that the number of retries is 1 less than the number of tries.) Option --maxtries adjusts the maximum try counts. Its argument consists of 3 comma-separated values. The following example sets the maximum try counts to 3 for write-only operations, 6 for write-read operations, and 9 for multi-part operations. --maxtries(3,6,9) A value of \"0\" or \".\" leaves the corresponding try count unchanged. The following example changes only the maximum write-read try count: --maxtries(0,7,.) The higest value to which a maximum try count can be set, is 15. Capabilities Caching capabilities is the most expensive ddcutil command in elapsed time. It is also the most prone to failure on marginal I2C host/monitor connections, due the large number of I2C request/response operations involved. The capabilities string is constant for any given monitor model. Therefore it makes sense to cache the value. Capabilities string caching is controlled by options --enable-capabilities-cache and --disable-capabilities-cache . The default is --enable-capabilities-cache . Option --disable-capabilities-cache may be needed for certain edge cases. The strings are saved in file ddcutil/capabilities within the XDG_CACHE_HOME directory. Normally this is $HOME/.cache/ddcutil/capabilities . This file can safely be erased if a stored capabilities string should become corrupted in some way. Option --discard-cache capabilities erases the stored capabilities strings at the start of program execution. Additional Peformance Related Options Option: --discard-cache[s] [capabilities|dsa|all] Discards the specified cache, or all caches, at the start of program execution. Alternatively, command discard caches can be used to delete cache files. Option: --async Enable parallel display inspection if 3 or more monitors are detected. See detect command . The benefit of this option has proven marginal at best. It may be eliminated in future releases. Option: --noverify Skip checking that a monitor has properly processed a DDC Set VCP Feature request packet.

It provides significant performance improvements by caching information queried from displays across program invocations, and by dynamically adjusting the sleep-multiplier time. It also should work \"out of the box\", without the need for post-installation configuration. The libddcutil API has been both extended and simplified. Because certain important changes broke backward compatibility, I took the opportunity for a major API cleanup. Unneeded functions were removed, including many that were previously deprecated. Most client programs should build with minimal changes. The new SONAME is libddcutil.so.5 . For backwards compatibility, libddcutil.so.4 from ddcutil 1.4.1 will continue to be available as a separate package. ddcui 0.4.0-rc1 is built to work with the updated API in ddcutil 2.0.0-rc1. Preliminary release notes are available at Notes for the Next ddcutil Release (Draft) , Shared Library Changes for the Next Release (Draft) , and Notes for the Next ddcui Release (Draft) . Changes are also summarized in the CHANGELOG.md files in the respective source trees. 17 January 2023 ddcutil release 1.4.1 fixes a critical bug in release 1.4.0. The default sleep-multiplier value was 0 instead of 1. As a result, commands that did not have an explcit --sleep-multiplier option would fail. All users of release 1.4.0 should upgrade. Thanks to github users copysiper (Oleg Tsvetkov) and fionnb for their help in quickly identifying and resolving this bug. 13 January 2023 ddcutil release 1.4.0 contains the following changes of general interest: ddcutil installation now creates a udev rule file that gives the logged on user read/write access to I 2 C devices associated with video monitors. Use of group i2c for granting permission to non-root users is, in general, no longer needed. Use of driver i2c-dev's file io interface (read()/write()), removed in release 1.3.0, has been restored. When i2c-dev's ioctl() interface is used the the Nvidia proprietary driver, depending on how the driver was built, it is possible for display detection to fail. If the Nvidia failure is detected, ddcutil switches to using the read()/write() interface for the Nvidia driver. In this case option --force-slave-address may be needed to handle EBUSY errors. For all other video drivers, the ioctl() interface is used and --force-slave-address has no effect. For a detailed description of ddcutil changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . 27 September 2022 Depending on how it was built, the proprietary nvidia driver can be incompatible with ddcutil 1.3.0 and 1.3.2. The effect is that no monitors are detected. Users encountering this problem should revert to using release 1.2.2, or can use the latest development branch on github. For details, see this github issue . Thank you to github user KeyOfBlueS for extensive and expert help in reporting and diagnosing this problem. 04 September 2022 ddcutil release 1.3.2 modifies tarball creation to eliminate garbage and otherwise unneeded files. Users of release 1.3.0 need not upgrade. 05 August 2022 ddcui release 0.3.0 contains the following changes of interest to general users; CTL-Q terminates ddcui (does not apply within dialog boxes) Errors opening /dev/i2c and /dev/usb/hiddev devices are reported using a message box instead of being written to the terminal. These errors typically reflect lack of permissions (Linux error EACCESS). Optionally requiring the control key to be pressed when changing feature values now applies to all changes, not just those made using sliders. (The option is set using command line option --require-control-key or the UI Options dialog box.). Options --force-slave-address and --disable-force-slave-address , introduced in Release 0.2.1, are deprecated and no longer have any effect. For a detailed description of ddcui changes and bug fixes in this release, see ddcui Release Notes . Prebuilt packages for several Linux distributions and mmachine architectures can be found in the ususal locations . Prior announcements can be found here . 23 July 2022 ddcutil release 1.3.0 contains the following changes of interest to general users: Option --force-slave-address no longer has any effect. Driver i2c-dev provides both a low level ioctl() interface and a higher level read()/write() interface for I 2 communication. ddcutil now uses the ioctl() interface (almost) exclusively. This eliminates the possbility of EBUSY errors from driver i2c-dev, which occur only when the read()/write() interface is used. Better reporting of user configuration issues at startup. Commands getvcp and vcpinfo can now take multiple features as arguments, for example ddcutil getvcp 10 12 . The sleep-suppression related options, --sleep-less , --less-sleep , --enable-sleep-suppression , and --disable-sleep-suppression no longer have any effect. For a detailed description of ddcutil changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prebuilt packages for several Linux distributions and mmachine architectures can be found in the ususal locations . 14 June 2022 ddcui 0.2.1 (along with ddcutil 1.2.2) is now available in the Debain Testing distribution (Bookworm). 02 February 2022 ddcui release 0.2.1 better handles DDC communication failures resulting from conflict with other programs. Like dddcutil 1.2.2, ddcui command line option -force-slave-address allows ddcui to override the other program's claim to the display. For a detailed description of ddcui changes and bug fixes in this release, see ddcui Release Notes . 28 January 2022 ddcutil release 1.2.2 contains one set of changes of interest to general users: Handling of DDC communication failures due to conflict with other programs is improved. In particular, conflict occurs when device driver ddcci is loaded. Among the changes: If ddcutil detect fails to communicate with a monitor and Linux errno EBUSY is reported, it reports the monitor as \"Busy\" instead of \"Invalid\" and suggests the use of option --force-slave-address . Messages regarding EBUSY errors are always written to the system log. API functions ddca_enable_force_slave_address() and ddca_is_force_slave_address_enabled() have been added. For a detailed description of ddcutil changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . 02 December 2021 ddcutil release 1.2.1 contains one change of interest to general users: Option --settings . Details of current settings are no longer reported by every command invocation when option --verbose is specified. Use option --settings to control option reporting. For a detailed description of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . 25 November 2021 ddcui release 0.2.0 is is now available on Github , and also from this site as a tarball . While not feature complete, this version should be useful to and usable by most people. For details, see ddcui Release Notes . 24 November 2021 ddcutil release candidate 1.2.1-rc2 is available as branch 1.2.1-rc2 on Github. For details, see the announcement on Github, file CHANGELOG.md, or the draft release notes . 05 October 2021 ddcutil release 1.2.0 contains the following changes of general interest: Command ddcutil --verbose now reports the raw EDID. Command ddcutil environment --verbose has been enhanced, primarily for remote /sys analysis. Major events are written to the system log. Most visible changes apply to the shared library. In particular: The shared library name is now libddcutil.so.4.1.0. Improved tracing. For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prior announcements can be found here . 05 April 2021 ddcutil release 1.1.0 contains the following changes of general interest: Configuration file ddcutilrc , located on the XDG config path (normally $HOME/.config/ddcutil/ddcutilrc) is processed by both ddcutil and libddcutil . Monitor capabilities strings are cached to improve performance of the capabilities command. Partial workarounds for problems in DRM video drivers (e.g. i915, AMDGPU) when monitors are connected to a docking station. The monitor may not be detected (because no EDID is reported), or the monitor may appear as two different /dev/i2c devices. When probing /dev/i2c devices for monitors, ddcutil could put AMD Navi2 devices (e.g. RX6000 series) into an inconsistent state. This is because the driver exposes an I 2 device for the SMU. Display detection is modified to avoid probing these devices. The interface exposed by shared library libddcutil is unchanged. Its SONAME remains \"libddcutil.so.4\", and the package name is libddcutil4 . For a complete list of ddcutil changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prior announcements can be found here . 08 February 2021 ddcutil release 1.0.1 addresses the situation wherein a display connected through a docking station is not detected when the i915 video driver is used. (I 2 support for docking station connected displays, and more generally displays using DisplayPort Multi Stream Transport. was recently implemented for i915 and amdgpu drivers in Kernel 5.10. Initial ddcutil code for this situation did not adequately work around problems in the driver implementation. 03 February 2021 ddcutil release 1.0.0 marks a milestone. It is time to regard ddcutil as having reached production status. There of course remain features to add, and the codebase warrants cleanup, but the feature set has been stable for some time. Bug reports are infrequent, and reflect unusual situations. There are two enhancements of general interest: User Defined Features , which have existed for some time, are now formally available. Option --mccs now applies to getvcp , setvcp , and dumpvcp as well as vcpinfo . The remaining changes in this release, while extensive, are likely of little interest to most users. The most notable changes are: ddcutil no longer by default checks for monitors exposing the Virtual Control Panel over USB. Such monitors have proven rare, and messages about lack of permission to read /dev/usb/hiddev devices can be be needless confusing. Command option --enable-usb will activate handling of USB connected monitors. The detect commands provides additional information about the monitors found. The capabilities command better handles malformed capabilities strings. getvcp has special handling for features x62 (audio volume), x87 (audio treble), x91 (audio bass), and x93 (audio balance). In MCCS 2.2 and 3.0, these otherwise continuous VCP features have special reserved values. Parsing setvcp command arguments was incorrect when multiple features are changed on a single setvcp command. The shared library API has minor, but not upwardly compatible, changes. The current library SONAME is libddcutil.so.4, and the library package is libddcutil4. Prior announcements can be found here . 09 July 2020 Branch master on github was out of sync with the reference tarball and prebuilt packages on launchpad , COPR , and the openSUSE Build Service . The missing changes have been pushed to the master branch. If you have already built release 0.9.9 from the github master branch, pull the changes and rebuild. 28 June 2020 ddcui release 0.1.2 is an emergency bug fix release. Combo boxes for simple Non-Continous features were empty instead of showing the currently selected value and list of allowed values. 24 June 2020 ddcutil release 0.9.9 contains two changes of general interest: A new command line option, --less-sleep eliminates many of the delays between the time that ddcutil receives a DDC response from a display and sends the next request, improving performance. Support for AMD's old proprietary fglrx driver has been dropped. The libddcutil shared libray has non-upwardly compatible changes. For details, see Shared Library Changes for Release 0.9.9 . ddcui release 0.1.1 adds additional features and has numerous changes in the \"fit and finish\" category. In particular: Command line options for starting ddcui , corresponding to settings in the Option dialogs, and (if multiple monitors) the initlal monitor selected. The Feature Selection Dialog , along with command line option --custom-feature-set , enable the user to specify the VCP features to be shown. Better handling of error conditions Better Help text ddcui release 0.1.1 requires ddcutil 0.9.9. For general information about the graphical user interface, see ddcui . For a complete list of ddcutil changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . For ddcui changes and bug fixes, see ddcui Release Notes . Prior announcements can be found here . Lastly, this website has been extensively revised to reflect the current state of ddcutil and ddcui . Note: Prebuilt packages are now available for ddcutil 0.9.9. 06 December 2019 ddcutil release 0.9.8 contains two changes of general interest: - A new command line option, --sleep-multiplier , adjusts the time ddcutil pauses between sending a request to the monitor and reading from the monitor. - A fix for the bug that certain mice would lock up during display detection. The libddcutil shared library API has some minor extensions. For details, see Library Changes for Release 0.9.8 . Graphical user interface ddcui has reached beta status. Release 0.1.0 contains numermous improvements in the handling of particular VCP feature codes and the user interface generally. Prebuilt packages now exist for many platforms. See ddcui Overview . For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prior announcements can be found here . 08 October 2019 ddcui alpha release 0.0.6 is now available on github . It requires the version of libddcutil provided by ddcutil release 0.9.7. 04 September 2019 ddcutil release 0.9.7 fixes the cause of a segfault during display detection if a monitor appearing to support the USB Monitor Control Class Specification , i.e. one that uses USB to communicate monitor settings, is connected to the system. If also contains some minor code cleanup. For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prior announcements can be found here . 25 August 2019 ddcutil release 0.9.6 contains minor enhancements, bug fixes, and API changes. SONAME versioning is now enabled for libddcutil . For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes .

However. the C API is extensively revised (see API Changes in Release 0.9.0 ). Two enhancements will be of interest to general users: - The setvcp command now allows new values for Continuous type features to be specified as relative values, e.g. the following commands increase or decrease the value of the brightness feature by 5. $ ddcutil setvcp 10 + 5 $ ddcutil setvcp 10 - 5 Note that parsing requires that \"+\" and \"-\" be surrounded by spaces. Table type features are by default not included in most feature groups specified on getvcp , e.g. getvcp known . Features of type Table are rare. The DDC/CI spec does not provide a clean way for getvcp to determine that a table feature does not exist. As a result, getvcp typically has to exceed its retry count before giving up. (Exclusion of table features does not occur if a feature is explicitly specified by its hex code, or for feature group TABLE .) The --no-table (formerly --notable ) and -show-table options explicitly control this behavior. For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes .

OBS 29 April 2017 At some time in the recent past, the files for release 0.7.3 in the OpenSUSE Build Service were corrupted with files from the test system. Symptoms of this corruption include Prefixing a VCP feature code number with \"0x\" causes a segfault, e.g. \"ddcutil setvcp 0x10 50\" Command line option \"--verify\" is recognized As of this morning, the production ddcutil project on OBS was restored to release 0.7.3. 0.7.3 05 March 2017 Release 0.7.3 is a maintenance release. There is no need to install it unless you are experiencing problems. This release introduces the following features: Command ddcutil detect --verbose shows additional information. Command ddcutil environment --verbose implements additional diagnostic tests. configure option --enable-drm controls whether DRM is used to enhance the diagnostics of command ddcutil environment --verbose . If enable-drm=yes , package libdrm-dev or libdrm-devel (depending on Linux distribution) must be installed to build ddcutil .

This release introduces the following features: Command option --force-slave-address causes ddcutil to attempt to take control of slave addresses on the I 2 bus even if they are in use by another driver. This may aid in certain situations where monitors on an I 2 bus are not properly detected. See Instrumentation and Tuning ) For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prior annoucnements can be found here . 0.7.0 03 January 2017 Release 0.7 introduces the following features: C API, exposed by shared library libddcutil . See API . A new command line option --mfg , allows for the 3 character manufaturer id found in the EDID to used as part of monitor selection. The monitor feature and capabilities portion of interrogate is also exposed by the new probe command which explores the capabilities string and features found on a single monitor. For details, see Release Notes . Prior annoucnements can be found here . openSUSE Build Service packaging of release 0.7.0 is complete. Owing to Launchpad constraints, the PPA will not be correct until ddcutil 's release is incremented, i.e. until release 0.7.1 0.6.1 21 November 2016 The most recent release of ddcutil is 0.6.1. This is a maintenance release and need not be installed unless you are experiencing problems. For details, see Release Notes . 0.6.0 01 October 2016 As of release 0.6, the name of this program changed from ddctool to ddcutil to avoid confusion with a commerical datacenter program also named ddctool. The following are affected: |Object |Old name | New Name | Comments| |-------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------| |Repository URL |https://github.com/rockowitz/ddctool.git | https://github.com/rockowitz/ddcutil.git | Old name still works | |Web site URL | http://www.ddctool.com | http://www.ddcutil.com | Old name still works | |Primary executable | ddctool | ddcutil | |Shared library | libddctool.so | libddcutil.so |","title":"Announcement History"},{"location":"prior_announcements/#prior-announcements","text":"15 June 2023 Release candidates ddcutil 2.0.0-rc1 and ddcui 0.4.0-rc1 are now available for testing as branches with those names on the github ddcutil and ddcui repositories. ddcutil 2.0.0 is a major release. It provides significant performance improvements by caching information queried from displays across program invocations, and by dynamically adjusting the sleep-multiplier time. It also should work \"out of the box\", without the need for post-installation configuration. The libddcutil API has been both extended and simplified. Because certain important changes broke backward compatibility, I took the opportunity for a major API cleanup. Unneeded functions were removed, including many that were previously deprecated. Most client programs should build with minimal changes. The new SONAME is libddcutil.so.5 . For backwards compatibility, libddcutil.so.4 from ddcutil 1.4.1 will continue to be available as a separate package. ddcui 0.4.0-rc1 is built to work with the updated API in ddcutil 2.0.0-rc1. Preliminary release notes are available at Notes for the Next ddcutil Release (Draft) , Shared Library Changes for the Next Release (Draft) , and Notes for the Next ddcui Release (Draft) . Changes are also summarized in the CHANGELOG.md files in the respective source trees. 17 January 2023 ddcutil release 1.4.1 fixes a critical bug in release 1.4.0. The default sleep-multiplier value was 0 instead of 1. As a result, commands that did not have an explcit --sleep-multiplier option would fail. All users of release 1.4.0 should upgrade. Thanks to github users copysiper (Oleg Tsvetkov) and fionnb for their help in quickly identifying and resolving this bug. 13 January 2023 ddcutil release 1.4.0 contains the following changes of general interest: ddcutil installation now creates a udev rule file that gives the logged on user read/write access to I 2 C devices associated with video monitors. Use of group i2c for granting permission to non-root users is, in general, no longer needed. Use of driver i2c-dev's file io interface (read()/write()), removed in release 1.3.0, has been restored. When i2c-dev's ioctl() interface is used the the Nvidia proprietary driver, depending on how the driver was built, it is possible for display detection to fail. If the Nvidia failure is detected, ddcutil switches to using the read()/write() interface for the Nvidia driver. In this case option --force-slave-address may be needed to handle EBUSY errors. For all other video drivers, the ioctl() interface is used and --force-slave-address has no effect. For a detailed description of ddcutil changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . 27 September 2022 Depending on how it was built, the proprietary nvidia driver can be incompatible with ddcutil 1.3.0 and 1.3.2. The effect is that no monitors are detected. Users encountering this problem should revert to using release 1.2.2, or can use the latest development branch on github. For details, see this github issue . Thank you to github user KeyOfBlueS for extensive and expert help in reporting and diagnosing this problem. 04 September 2022 ddcutil release 1.3.2 modifies tarball creation to eliminate garbage and otherwise unneeded files. Users of release 1.3.0 need not upgrade. 05 August 2022 ddcui release 0.3.0 contains the following changes of interest to general users; CTL-Q terminates ddcui (does not apply within dialog boxes) Errors opening /dev/i2c and /dev/usb/hiddev devices are reported using a message box instead of being written to the terminal. These errors typically reflect lack of permissions (Linux error EACCESS). Optionally requiring the control key to be pressed when changing feature values now applies to all changes, not just those made using sliders. (The option is set using command line option --require-control-key or the UI Options dialog box.). Options --force-slave-address and --disable-force-slave-address , introduced in Release 0.2.1, are deprecated and no longer have any effect. For a detailed description of ddcui changes and bug fixes in this release, see ddcui Release Notes . Prebuilt packages for several Linux distributions and mmachine architectures can be found in the ususal locations . Prior announcements can be found here . 23 July 2022 ddcutil release 1.3.0 contains the following changes of interest to general users: Option --force-slave-address no longer has any effect. Driver i2c-dev provides both a low level ioctl() interface and a higher level read()/write() interface for I 2 communication. ddcutil now uses the ioctl() interface (almost) exclusively. This eliminates the possbility of EBUSY errors from driver i2c-dev, which occur only when the read()/write() interface is used. Better reporting of user configuration issues at startup. Commands getvcp and vcpinfo can now take multiple features as arguments, for example ddcutil getvcp 10 12 . The sleep-suppression related options, --sleep-less , --less-sleep , --enable-sleep-suppression , and --disable-sleep-suppression no longer have any effect. For a detailed description of ddcutil changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prebuilt packages for several Linux distributions and mmachine architectures can be found in the ususal locations . 14 June 2022 ddcui 0.2.1 (along with ddcutil 1.2.2) is now available in the Debain Testing distribution (Bookworm). 02 February 2022 ddcui release 0.2.1 better handles DDC communication failures resulting from conflict with other programs. Like dddcutil 1.2.2, ddcui command line option -force-slave-address allows ddcui to override the other program's claim to the display. For a detailed description of ddcui changes and bug fixes in this release, see ddcui Release Notes . 28 January 2022 ddcutil release 1.2.2 contains one set of changes of interest to general users: Handling of DDC communication failures due to conflict with other programs is improved. In particular, conflict occurs when device driver ddcci is loaded. Among the changes: If ddcutil detect fails to communicate with a monitor and Linux errno EBUSY is reported, it reports the monitor as \"Busy\" instead of \"Invalid\" and suggests the use of option --force-slave-address . Messages regarding EBUSY errors are always written to the system log. API functions ddca_enable_force_slave_address() and ddca_is_force_slave_address_enabled() have been added. For a detailed description of ddcutil changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . 02 December 2021 ddcutil release 1.2.1 contains one change of interest to general users: Option --settings . Details of current settings are no longer reported by every command invocation when option --verbose is specified. Use option --settings to control option reporting. For a detailed description of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . 25 November 2021 ddcui release 0.2.0 is is now available on Github , and also from this site as a tarball . While not feature complete, this version should be useful to and usable by most people. For details, see ddcui Release Notes . 24 November 2021 ddcutil release candidate 1.2.1-rc2 is available as branch 1.2.1-rc2 on Github. For details, see the announcement on Github, file CHANGELOG.md, or the draft release notes . 05 October 2021 ddcutil release 1.2.0 contains the following changes of general interest: Command ddcutil --verbose now reports the raw EDID. Command ddcutil environment --verbose has been enhanced, primarily for remote /sys analysis. Major events are written to the system log. Most visible changes apply to the shared library. In particular: The shared library name is now libddcutil.so.4.1.0. Improved tracing. For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prior announcements can be found here . 05 April 2021 ddcutil release 1.1.0 contains the following changes of general interest: Configuration file ddcutilrc , located on the XDG config path (normally $HOME/.config/ddcutil/ddcutilrc) is processed by both ddcutil and libddcutil . Monitor capabilities strings are cached to improve performance of the capabilities command. Partial workarounds for problems in DRM video drivers (e.g. i915, AMDGPU) when monitors are connected to a docking station. The monitor may not be detected (because no EDID is reported), or the monitor may appear as two different /dev/i2c devices. When probing /dev/i2c devices for monitors, ddcutil could put AMD Navi2 devices (e.g. RX6000 series) into an inconsistent state. This is because the driver exposes an I 2 device for the SMU. Display detection is modified to avoid probing these devices. The interface exposed by shared library libddcutil is unchanged. Its SONAME remains \"libddcutil.so.4\", and the package name is libddcutil4 . For a complete list of ddcutil changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prior announcements can be found here . 08 February 2021 ddcutil release 1.0.1 addresses the situation wherein a display connected through a docking station is not detected when the i915 video driver is used. (I 2 support for docking station connected displays, and more generally displays using DisplayPort Multi Stream Transport. was recently implemented for i915 and amdgpu drivers in Kernel 5.10. Initial ddcutil code for this situation did not adequately work around problems in the driver implementation. 03 February 2021 ddcutil release 1.0.0 marks a milestone. It is time to regard ddcutil as having reached production status. There of course remain features to add, and the codebase warrants cleanup, but the feature set has been stable for some time. Bug reports are infrequent, and reflect unusual situations. There are two enhancements of general interest: User Defined Features , which have existed for some time, are now formally available. Option --mccs now applies to getvcp , setvcp , and dumpvcp as well as vcpinfo . The remaining changes in this release, while extensive, are likely of little interest to most users. The most notable changes are: ddcutil no longer by default checks for monitors exposing the Virtual Control Panel over USB. Such monitors have proven rare, and messages about lack of permission to read /dev/usb/hiddev devices can be be needless confusing. Command option --enable-usb will activate handling of USB connected monitors. The detect commands provides additional information about the monitors found. The capabilities command better handles malformed capabilities strings. getvcp has special handling for features x62 (audio volume), x87 (audio treble), x91 (audio bass), and x93 (audio balance). In MCCS 2.2 and 3.0, these otherwise continuous VCP features have special reserved values. Parsing setvcp command arguments was incorrect when multiple features are changed on a single setvcp command. The shared library API has minor, but not upwardly compatible, changes. The current library SONAME is libddcutil.so.4, and the library package is libddcutil4. Prior announcements can be found here . 09 July 2020 Branch master on github was out of sync with the reference tarball and prebuilt packages on launchpad , COPR , and the openSUSE Build Service . The missing changes have been pushed to the master branch. If you have already built release 0.9.9 from the github master branch, pull the changes and rebuild. 28 June 2020 ddcui release 0.1.2 is an emergency bug fix release. Combo boxes for simple Non-Continous features were empty instead of showing the currently selected value and list of allowed values. 24 June 2020 ddcutil release 0.9.9 contains two changes of general interest: A new command line option, --less-sleep eliminates many of the delays between the time that ddcutil receives a DDC response from a display and sends the next request, improving performance. Support for AMD's old proprietary fglrx driver has been dropped. The libddcutil shared libray has non-upwardly compatible changes. For details, see Shared Library Changes for Release 0.9.9 . ddcui release 0.1.1 adds additional features and has numerous changes in the \"fit and finish\" category. In particular: Command line options for starting ddcui , corresponding to settings in the Option dialogs, and (if multiple monitors) the initlal monitor selected. The Feature Selection Dialog , along with command line option --custom-feature-set , enable the user to specify the VCP features to be shown. Better handling of error conditions Better Help text ddcui release 0.1.1 requires ddcutil 0.9.9. For general information about the graphical user interface, see ddcui . For a complete list of ddcutil changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . For ddcui changes and bug fixes, see ddcui Release Notes . Prior announcements can be found here . Lastly, this website has been extensively revised to reflect the current state of ddcutil and ddcui . Note: Prebuilt packages are now available for ddcutil 0.9.9. 06 December 2019 ddcutil release 0.9.8 contains two changes of general interest: - A new command line option, --sleep-multiplier , adjusts the time ddcutil pauses between sending a request to the monitor and reading from the monitor. - A fix for the bug that certain mice would lock up during display detection. The libddcutil shared library API has some minor extensions. For details, see Library Changes for Release 0.9.8 . Graphical user interface ddcui has reached beta status. Release 0.1.0 contains numermous improvements in the handling of particular VCP feature codes and the user interface generally. Prebuilt packages now exist for many platforms. See ddcui Overview .

In that case, the above i2c2_iknowwhatimdoing setting is not needed, though this may possibly change: dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d Also, ensure that i2c_dev is listed in /etc/modules, /etc/modules.conf, or a file in /etc/modules-load.d, as appropriate for your system. Prebuilt ddcutil packages for the Raspberry Pi are available for many distributions. See Repology for pointers. If there is no prebuilt version for your environment, or the prebuilt version is out of date, ddcutil can be built from source. Background Enabling /dev/i2c-2 requires the peculiar dtpararm statement described above, instead of the more expected: # Won't work! dtparam=i2c2 The parameter name was chosen as a caution. From the commit that added the option: The third I2C bus (I2C2) is normally reserved for HDMI use. Careless use of this bus can break an attached display - use with caution. It is recommended to disable accesses by VideoCore by setting hdmi_ignore_edid=1 or hdmi_edid_file=1 in config.txt. The interface is disabled by default - enable using the i2c2_iknowwhatimdoing DT parameter. The issue appears to be that application access to /dev/i2c-2 from the CPU is independent of, and so can conflict with, video driver access via the GPU (at least with the default driver). From an online comment : Yes, but the GPU considers itself to be the sole user of the BSC2 peripheral.

As long as you stay away from hotplugging HDMI, or tvservice commands (or anything likely to use tvservice) then the GPU is unlikely cause any traffic on BSC2. As a practical matter, this does not appear to be an issue. Concerns have also been expressed about 3.3v vs 5v voltage incompatibility on the I2C bus, since the HDMI spec is 5v. However, as I read the I2C Specification any recent I2C implementation should be able to adapt to voltages up to 5.5 volt.

See Shared Library Changes for Release 2.1.4 . 2.1.3 07 Feb 2024 Release 2.1.3 fixes a bug in libddcutil that caused API calls to fail with status code DDCRC_ARG (invalid argument) when passed an otherwise valid display reference for a display that doesn't support DDC/CI. This caused ddcui to crash when querying information about such a display. In addition: Option --settings reports build options. Improved determination of whether all display drivers support DRM 2.1.2 27 Jan 2024 Release 2.1.2 fixes a critical bug in libddcutil that caused older versions of PowerDevil to repeatedly crash and restart. In additon: It fixes some low-impact bugs, and better accomodates the proprietary Nvidia video driver. Option --min-dynamic-multiplier is no longer marked hidden (i.e. not reported by the normal --help option). It sets a floor to the speed multiplier caclulated by the dynamic sleep algorithm, which may improve performance in some situations by reducing \"jitter\". Option --vstats additionally reports the minumum, maximum, and average successful sleep multiplier. 2.1.0 16 Jan 2024 Tuning Initialization ddcutil initialization typically consumes most of the elapsed time of command execution. For devices using DDC/CI (i.e. all but the few that communicate the with the monitor's Virtual Control Panel using USB), there are roughly speaking two phases to this process. First, every /dev/i2c device associated with a video display adapter is examined to determine if it has an EDID, i.e. if it is associated with a connected monitor. After that, each of the /dev/i2c devices associated with monitors are tested to see if DDC/CI communication works for the /dev/i2c device. This includes a check that the monitor adheres to the DDC/CI specification for reporting unsupported features; if not, ddcutil attempts to figure out if there is some other way the monitor reports unsupported features. To speed up this process, the following changes have been made. - Option ***--ddc-check-async-min*** specifies a threshold number for performing the DDC related checks in parallel. The optimal value is a tradeoff between the time savings from parellel execution and the overhead of splitting execution into multiple threads. This tradeoff will vary by processor speed and the number of threads available. The default value is 3, i.e. parallelize execution if 3 or more monitors are present. - The ambiguously named ***--async*** option has been is deprecated and now has no effect. Previously, it turned on parallel execution of DDC related checks in a multi-monitor situation, no matter the number of monitors. - As a practical matter, once you know that your display adheres to the DDC/CI spec, there's no need to perform the DDC level check every time **ddcutil** is invoked. Option ***--skip-ddc-checks*** disables the DDC level checks completely. Dynamic Sleep Always set sleep multiplier to at least 1.0 for commands setvcp and scs . Addresses reports that aggressive optimization caused setvcp to fail. Cross-Instance Locking The cross-instance locking feature uses system call flock() to ensure that operations on /dev/i2c devices by multiple instances of ddcutil or libddcutil do not interfere. All instances must use option --enable-cross-instance-locks . If a conflict is encoutered, information is reported to the terminal. Switching input source on recent LG monitors Option --i2c-source-addr causes setvcp to use the specified address instead of the value x51 given in DDC/CI specification. User experimentation has found that using an alternate source address accesses additional features on some LG monitors. See Switching Input Source on LG Monitors . Miscellaneous Changes Better handling of DDC Null Message recognition and adjustments Dynamic sleep: make it easier to reduce time - once high didn't come down Command detect: ensure output of model name, serial number, and extra display descriptor use only ASCII character in the range 0..127. Some USB-only code was not iftested out when configure option --disable-usb was set. (Issue 355) Cross-thread locking handles situtations where a display ref does not yet exist, e.g. reading EDID Deprecate vaguely named option --force . Replace its single use with option --permit-unknown-feature , which applies only to command setvcp . Deprecate vaguely named option --ddc . Instead use --ddcdata , which more clearly indicates that it causes DDC data errors to be reported. Option --version : The amount of detail shown is now modified by options --brief and --vebose . If --brief is specified, just the version string is shown. If --verbose is specified, detailed build information is reported. Option --help : Show extended help on argument values only if --verbose is also specified. Command detect . EDID text fields FF (Display serial number), FC (Display Name) and FE (Unspecified Use) are supposed to contain only ASCII characters, i.e. single byte characters in the range 0..127. There have been reports of \"garbage\" output from detect because of characters in the range 128..255. Any characters in the range 128..255, along with control characters in the range 1..31. Command detect : Clearer messages for laptop displays. Do not report \"DDC communication failed\" Report \"Is laptop display\" instead of \"Is eDP device\" or \"Is LVDS device\" If multiple \"options:\" lines are found in a segment of ini file ddcutilrc, their contents are combined into a single value Building configure option --enable-asan added. Turns on ASAN related compiler options and links libasan into binaries. configure option --enable-x11 is deprecated and has no effect. The X11 API is no longer used. Distribution packagers should eliminate requirements for X11 related libraries. The option will be completely removed in a future release. 1.4.5 23 October 2023 Release 1.4.5 extends release 1.4.1 by backporting a configure command option, --enable-install-lib-only , from release 2.0.0. If this option is used, make will build and install only shared library libddcutil.so.4 . This option may be useful for Linux distributions that must install this legacy library along with the newer libddcutil.so.5 from ddcutil 2.x.x, in order to support existing applications that require that earlier library. 2.0.0 27 September 2023 Release 2.0.0 is a major update to ddcutil , containing significant performance improvements. For detailed information about libddcutil changes, see Shared Library Release Notes . Shared library libddcutil.so.5 , built from the ddcutil 2.0.0 source, is not backwards compatible - some programs using the library may need to be recompiled. For detailed notes about libddcutil changes, see Shared Library Release Notes . Installation ddcutil installation creates file /usr/lib/modules-load.d/ddcutil.conf to ensure that kernel module i2c-dev is loaded at boot time (if it was not built into the kernel). As of Release 1.4.1, ddcutil installation created file /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/60-ddcutil.rules, granting the logged on user read/write access to I 2 C devices associated with video monitors. This file has been renamed to 60-ddcutil-i2c.rules. New file 60-ddcutil-usb.rules performs a similar task for USB Human Interface Devices that may provide an interface to the monitor's Virtual Control Panel. For unusual situations, sample files /usr/share/data/ddcutil/60-ddcutil-i2c.rules and 60-ddcutil-usb.rules provide alternative ways to grant permissions. Taken together, these changes mean that ddcutil should just work \"out of the box\" with no special system configuration. The most signficiant exception is the special settings that may still be needed for the proprietary Nvidia driver. Performance Improvement Dynamic Sleep Adjustment The dynamic sleep algorithm has been completely rewritten to both dynamically increase the sleep-multiplier factor (as needed) and decrease the sleep multiplier factor (insofar as possible). Data is maintained across program executions in file $HOME/.cache/ddcutil/stats. Option -dsa , or one of its variants such as --enable-dsa turn it on (the default). Option --disable-dsa turns it off. If both --sleep-multiplier and --dsa are specified, existing statistics are discarded and the sleep algorithm restarts calculation with the specified sleep-multiplier value. Therefore --sleep-multiplier should generally not be used along with --dsa . Performance Cache Management There are two ways to explicitly delete the capabilities and/or dynamic sleep caches. - Command discard capabilities | dsa | all cache[s] - Option --dicard-cache[s] capabilities|dsa|all erases caches at the start of a command. System Logs Writing to the system log has been generalized and in the process simplified. Option --syslog <level> controls what is written to the system log. Recognized levels, in order of increasing verbosity, are NEVER, ERROR, WARN, NOTICE, INFO, VERBOSE, and DEBUG. This option replaces --enable-syslog , --disable-syslog , and --trace-to-syslog . The default for ddcutil is WARN, and for libddcutil is NOTICE. environment --verbose Changes Option --quickenv skips some slow tests such as use of program i2cdetect. Extended sysfs scan for ARM SOC devices to explore how those devices use /sys Report contents of cached files Switching input source on recent LG monitors Recent LG monitors allow for splitting the display screen between multiple input sources. They use an undocumented protocol, instead of the (relatively) simple VCP feature X60 (Input Source), to control how the screen is split and which input source is shown where. Thanks to a community effort, particularly by user Max Thomas (Github handle shinyquagmire23 ), some of this protocol has been reverse engineered. It entails using an alternative I 2 C source address, x50 instead of x51 in the I 2 packet. Option --i2c-source-addr provides a way to use this alternative address in DDC communication. For further details, see wiki page . The extended discussion summarized on the wiki page occurred on ddcutil issue 100: LG 29UM69G fails switching input . ddcutil detect Changes Option --verbose reports the current dynamic sleep muliplier. Improve determination of non-standard ways that unsupported VCP features are reported, ane report that output may be incorrect if detection of invalid features is unreliable. Improved identification of \"phantom\" displays when a monitor is capable of DisplayPort Multi-Stream Transport passthrough. Warn that output may be inaccurate if the monitor appears to be in a sleep mode. Miscellanous Changes Option --sleep-multiplier 0 is now allowed. Some DisplayPort monitors have been observed to work with this value. The tests durng display detection to check for misuse of the DDC Null Message or an all zero getvcp response to indicate unsupported features have been made more robust. Option --noconfig : Do not process the configuration file. Option --trcfrom <function name> : Trace the specified function and its called functions. (This option reports only functions for which tracing has been enabled.) Option --hh . The number of command line options has become huge. Many are development related. Options not of interest to general users are now hidden. Option --hh exposes them, and implies option --help . Option --verbose . If specified on the command line, the options obtained from the configuration file are reported. Detailed statistics are now maintained on a per-display instead of per-thread basis. Option --vstats reports detailed statistics, in particular per-display statistics. --vstats takes the same arguments as --stats . Option --help . Document ELAPSED as a recognized statistics class Option --help reports option --force as deprecated. Reading the EDID when using USB to communicate with a monitor's virtual control panel can fail. Try using a fallback mechanisms to read the EDID for any Eizo displays, not just those with a specific product id. Existing cached capabilities are not erased when ddcutil is called with capabilities caching disabled. Options --ignore-hiddev and --ignore-usb-pid-vid cause ddcutil initialization to ignore USB Human Interface devices that could possibly provide standards-conformant USB access to the monitor's Video Control Panel. ddcutil already ignores HID devices that are declared as keyboards or mice, as probing such devices can cause system lockups. The options are provided because it is conceivable that other such devices exist. Improve reporting of /dev/hiddev open failures, to avoid confusion resulting from this typically benign error. Fix segfaults in cacheing due to $HOME not set. Fix segfault in shared library termination. ddcui now uses a separate configuration file, $HOME/.config/ddcutil/ddcuirc. If X11 is the display manager, terminate immediately if the monitor is in a DPMS sleep mode. For Wayland, the best that can be done at present is to detect if an individual monitor is in a DPMS sleep mode. In that case, or the case of no display manager, DPMS status is determined during display detection. Building configure options -enable-syslog / --disable-syslog have been removed. Instead, use command line option --syslog never at runtime to disable all writes to the system log. Shared library libkmod is no longer required. Shared library libjansson is now required. Its development package (libjansson-dev on Debian based systems) must be installed. If congfigure option --enable-install-lib-only is specified, command make install installs only the shared library Development Facilities Added termporary use options --f7, --f8, --i2, --s1, --s2, --s3, --s4, --fl1, --fl2. The current meaning of these options is reported by option --settings . Added utility command C1 for temporary use during development. Added option --enable-mock-data 1.4.1 16 January 2023 Release 1.4.1 fixes a critical bug in release 1.4.0 affecting both command line program ddcutil and shared library libddcutil . The default sleep-multiplier value was 0 instead of 1. As a result, commands that did not have an explcit --sleep-multiplier option would fail. All users of release 1.4.0 should upgrade. Thank you github users copysiper (Oleg Tsvetkov) and fionnb for your help in quickly identifying and resolving this bug. 1.4.0 13 January 2023 Nvidia Proprietary Driver Workaround Release 1.3.0 simplified coding by exclusively using the ioctl() interface in driver i2c-dev as opposed to the write()/read() file io interface. This had the additional benefit of making option --force-slave-address irrelevant. Unfortunately, this change exposed an error in how the proprietary Nvidia driver is coded. Because of this error, depending on the version of header file i2c.h used when the driver is built, all reads and writes using ioctl() fail. Therefore, the ability to use the write()/read() intead of ioctl() for writing and reading has been restored. By default, the ioctl interface is used for all drivers. The initial IO mechanism used can be forced by new options --use-file-io and --use-ioctl-io , but these options are really only for testing purposes. ddcutil will revert to using the file io interface if the Nvidia error is detected using the ioctl interface. There should be no benefit to using the file io interface with other than the Nvidia driver. Note, however, that when using the file io interface, option --force-slave-address is once again relevant for handling EBUSY errors. I2C Device Permissions Simplified Until now, the recommended way give-non root users access to the I2C devices is as outlined on the existing I2C Device Permissions page. In short, all /dev/i2c devices are assigned to group i2c, and have read/write access to those devices. This happens automatically in ddcutil packages for Debian and derived distributions such as Ubuntu, because package ddcutil depends on package i2c-tools. All that remains is for ddcutil users to be added to group i2c. Release 1.4.0 simplifies permissions by adding a udev rule that uses the uaccess tag to give the logged on user read/write access to all /dev/i2c devices associated with video adapters. (See issue 275 ). Installing package ddcutil installs file /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/60-ddcutil.rules (or /usr/local/lib/udev/rules.d/60-ddcutil.rules). If building from source without actually installing ddcutil, you can copy file data/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/60-ddcutil.rules to directory /etc/udev/rules.d. Thank you to github user digitaltrails (Michael Hamilton) for suggesting this change. libddcutil Changes The ABI is unchanged from release 1.3.0. The full shared library name is libddcutil.4.3.0. ddca_set_default_sleep_multiplier_value() , ddca_set_sleep_multiplier_value() : Accept 0 as a valid argument. ddca_enable_force_slave_address() . This function was made a NO-OP in release 1.3.0. It is once again has effect. For details on libddcutil changes, see Shared Library Changes for Release 1.4.0 . Building ddcutil New configure options: --enable-syslog/--disable-syslog control whether messages are written to the system log, which can pose problems if executing in a container. The default is --enable-syslog . Compiler option -WError is only used when building a development version of ddcutil, e.g. 1.4.0-dev. If -WError is specified, compilation can fail on a system other than the development system, having different compiler warnings enabled. configure.ac: Only invoke deprecated macro AC_PROG_CC_99 if autoconf version < 2.70 Suppress sleeps Option --sleep-multiplier and API functions ddca_set_default_sleep_multiplier_value() and ddca_set_sleep_multplier_value() now accept 0 as an argument, which disables sleeps. This is intended for calling programs that wish to control sleep time themselves. Multiple monitors having the same EDID It is rare, but possible, to have multiple monitors with identical EDIDs. For example, the ASUS PG329Q has neither a character or a binay serial number in its EDID, and a user had a pair of monitors built in the same week, so the EDIDs were identical. If multiple monitors with identical EDIDs are used with the nvidia proprietary driver, the DRM connector name cannot be reliably determined. Command detect issues a warning in this situation. Miscellaneous Command environment --verbose : Report the build options in effect. The ddcutil command parser reports an error if a display selection option (e.g. --bus , --model ) is given on a command to which it does not apply. Handle /dev/i2c device names with a double hyphen, e.g. /dev/i2c--3. libddcutil: Better handling of configuration file errors, do not abort. See github issue #289 . Write additional error and information messages to the system log Command detect : Eliminate message \"Is DDC/CI enabled in the monitor's on-screen display?\" It's rarely the problem. Command detect --verbose : For EDID version 1.4, correct the interpretation of the digital display type bits, e.g. \"RGB 4:4:4\". Fix miscellaneous segfaults 1.3.2 04 September 2022 ddcutil release 1.3.2 modifies tarball creation to eliminate garbage and otherwise unneeded files. Users of release 1.3.0 need not upgrade. 1.3.0 23 July 2022 Brickable Monitors There have been a handful of reports of monitors for which setting a feature value, most commonly in the manufacturer reserved range, puts the monitor into some difficult to recover state. A warning is issued at startup for those monitors. Currently the only monitor in the warning list is Xaomi model \"Mi Monitor\". Device Busy (EBUSY) Errors Driver i2c-dev provides both a low level ioctl() interface and a higher level read()/write() interface for I2C communication. ddcutil now uses the ioctl() interface (almost) exclusively. This eliminates the possbility of EBUSY errors from driver i2c-dev, which occur only when the read()/write() interface is used. As a result, option -force-slave-address no longer has any effect. In principle, EBUSY errors are still possible from within individual video drivers invoked by i2c-dev, but this has never been observed. Better Report User Configuration Issues More user friendly messages at startup regarding /dev/i2c buses that cannont be opened. If the problem is inadequate permissions (EACCES), the user is directed to the web site . Report at startup if required device driver i2c-dev is not built into the kernel and has not been loaded. Command detect Option --verbose produces addtional information: The product code is reported in hex as well as decimal The EDID source field is set to I2C in the normal case where the EDID is read directly from slave address X50. Alternative values include USB , X11 , and SYSFS . Commands getvcp , vcpinfo Allow specification of multiple feature codes, for example ddcutil getvcp 10 12 , ddcutil vcpinfo 14 16 18 1a Command environment Scanning of /sys by option --verbose has been improved. Better handle malformed EDIDs Trailing blanks on model and serial number are stripped. This affects commands detect --terse , loadvcp and dumpvcp , and also the file names of user defined features. Option --stats : I2C ioctl() calls for reading and writing are now reported as type IE_IOCTL_WRITE and IE_IOCTL_READ rather than IE_OTHER. IE_WRITE_READ stats are no longer reported, as they are redundant. Performance Options Option --dsa / --dynamic-sleep-adjustment : The Dynamic Sleep Adjustment algorithm was rewritten to more sensibly increment sleep times after before each retry. Sleeps immediately after opening a /dev/i2c device and after completion of a read operation are completely eliminated. The sleep-suppression related uptions, --sleep-less , --less-sleep, --enable-sleep-suppression , and --disable-sleep-suppression*** no longer have any effect. Miscellaneous Bug Fixes The sleep multiplier value was not respected for new API threads. User Defined Features: Keyword NC set the incorrect flag in a feature descriptor. Fixed a segfault in ddcutil initialization because of unexpected contents in sysfs. Double count I2C writes in stats. libddcutil Fixed a segfault that occurred at shared library startup. The fault was in a trace message for function ddc_start_watch_displays() which watches for displays that are added or removed. Deprecated API functions have no effect: ddca_enable_force_slave_address() , ddca_is_force_slave_address_enabled() For details on libddcutil changes, see Shared Library Changes for Release 1.3.0 . 1.2.2 28 January 2022 Device Busy (EBUSY) Errors This release improves the handling of and messages regarding DDC communication failures with errno EBUSY. In particular, this error occurs when driver ddcci is loaded. Command detect : If DDC communication fails with error EBUSY, report the display as \"Busy\" instead of \"Invalid\" and suggest use of option --force-slave-address . Command environment : If driver ddcci is loaded, suggest use of option --force-slave-address . Messages regarding EBUSY errors are always written to the system log. Added API functions ddca_enable_force_slave_address() , ddca_is_force_slave_address_enabled() . Building and Porting When building ddcutil , allow for linking a static library if configure option --enable-static is set. By default, static libraries are not built, since Linux distributions generally frown on their inclusion in packages. Calls to function __assert_fail() have been replaced with exit() in traced assertions. __assert_fail is part of the Linux implementation of assert() , but is not in the C specification. This change simplifies porting of ddcutil to environments lacking this function. Avoid compilation warnings when assertions are disabled (NDEBUG is defined). Miscellaneous Changes Command detect reports additional EDID detail for option verbose . This information, including EDID version and color related detail, has no effect on ddcutil execution but may be of general interest to some users. Fixes Only write messages to the system log regarding ddcutil starting and termination if option --syslog is specified. libddcutil Changes For details on libddcutil changes on releases 1.2.0/1.2.1/1.2.2, see Shared Library Changes for Release 1.2.0 . 1.2.1 02 December 2021 Option -settings Until now, details of the current configuration and option settings have been shown at the start of any command when --verbose is in effect. This information has become increasing large and distracting. Instead, this information is now reported only when option --settings is specified. Tracing Option --syslog sends trace and debug messages to the system log in addition to the trace location. Option --wall-timestamp-- or --wts preface trace and debug messages with the current wall time. Fixes Build would fail when configure option ---enable x11=no was specified. API functions ddca_open_display() and ddca_open_display2() now always return DDCRC_ALREADY_OPEN if the display is already open in the current thread. Previously an assert failure would occur under certain circumstances. Numerous memory leaks in libddcutil have been plugged. 1.2.0 05 October 2021 Most visible changes in release 1.2.0 affect only shared library libddcutil . Users of the command line program ddcutil do not need to update. General Changes Option --enable-capabilities-cache is now the default. Command detect --verbose now reports the raw EDID. Major events are written to the system log. These include starting, stopping, and severe internal errors. Fix for github issue #178: Error detecting i2c-dev kernel module . The checks now use library libkmod (which is the basis for commands modinfo, lsmod, etc.). environment command If programs get-edid and parse-edid are installed, command ddcutil environment --verbose uses them for an addiional EDID check Extend sysfs diagnostics in ddcutil environment --verbose to better analyze problems in DisplayPort Multi-Stream Transport, in which a display appears as 2 different /dev/i2c devices. ddcutil environment --verbose now includes all the information of ddcutil detect --verbose . There is no need to submit the latter along with the former in issue reports. libddcutil Changes See Shared Library Changes for Release 1.2.0 1.1.0 05 April 2021 Docking station connected displays At long last, Linux kernel release 5.10 implemented DDC communication over DisplayPort Multi-Stream Transport. Most commonly, this is seen with displays connected to docking stations. For several years now, all docking station connected displays, even those using HDMI or DVI connections, internally rely on a DisplayPort MST connection between the computer and the docking station. The kernel changes were made in the Direct Rendering Mode (DRM) subsytem. The Intel i915 and AMD amdgpu drivers, which are implemented as part of DRM, have been tested and (mostly) work. Other drivers part of the kernel DRM component, e.g. nouveau, should also work but have not been tested. Nvidia's proprietary driver uses it own proprietary DRM implementation and still does not support DDC communication over MST. Unfortunately there are problems with the DRM code, which ddcutil can only sometimes work around. Sometimes the display's EDID cannot be read on I2C slave address x50. As a result, ddcutil does not report the existence of a display connected to the /dev/i2c device. ddcutil attempts to work around this by trying to read the EDID multiple times with both 128 and 256 block sizes. Depending on the monitor, usually one or the other will work, but sometimes neither do. Option --edid-read-size , which was introduced in release 1.0.1, can force the block size to 128 or 256. This problem can be unrecoverable when the computer suspends and resumes, requiring reboot. On the other hand, the same monitor may appear as two different /dev/i2c devices, only one of which supports DDC. Curiously EDID read failures are associated with the /dev/i2c device that supports DDC. ddcutil attempts to detect which /dev/i2c device should be used for monitor communication, and the detect command reports the other as a \"Phantom Display\" instead of an \"Invalid Display\". (Thank you laur89 for the wonderfully apt term.) My sincere thanks to github users laur89 and boscard for their considerable help in diagnosing this situation and testing (partial) solutions. Configuration file ddcutilrc ddcutil 's command options have proliferated, often to address problems specific to a small number of users. To simplify their use, they can now be specified in a configuration file. For details, see Configuration File Persistent capabilities capabilities is the most expensive ddcutil command in elapsed time. It is also the most prone to failure on marginal I2C host/monitor connections, due the large number of I2C requests involved. On the other hand, the capabilities string is constant for a monitor model. ddcutil now caches capaiblities strings, significantly speeding up execution of the capabilities command. This feature is controlled by options --enable-capabilities-cache and --disable-capabilities-cache . The default is --enable-capabilities-cache . --disable-capabilities-cache may be needed as there are some edge cases not yet addressed The cache is located in file ddcutil/capabilities of the XDG cache directory. Typically this is $HOME/.cache/ddcutil/capabilities. This file can safely be erased if the stored capabilities string should become corrupted in some way. Miscellaneous Warn the user at ddcutil startup if module i2c-dev is neither loaded nor built into the kernel. This should help new users properly configure their systems. More detailed output on the detect command, particularly with option --verbose . environment --verbose has more extensive diagnostics, particulary of /sys Avoid corrupting the state of AMD Navi4 gpus, e.g. RX 6000 series, by not examining SMU I2C buses on the video adapter. Building ddcutil configure option --disable-usb now implies --disable-udev . This addresses a build failure reported by Amon Sha. 1.0.1 08 February 2021 This bug fix release addresses the situation wherein a display connected through a docking station was not detecteed when the i915 video driver is used. (I2C support for docking station connected displays, and more generally displays using DisplayPort Multi Stream Transport. was recently implemented for i915 and amdgpu drivers in Kernel 5.10. Initial ddcutil code for this situation did not adequately work around problems in the driver implementation, with the result that the EDID was not read in certain contexts. Option --edid-read-size Command line option --edid-read-size , introduced in release 1.0.0, is no longer needed. ddcutil not attempts both 128 and 256 byte reads to fetch the EDID. 1.0.0 03 February 2021 User Defined Features ddcutil , for some time now, has implementated user supplied feature definitions. This facility is now formally available. A feature definition file for a monitor model specifies feature definitions that add to or override those in the MCCS spec. It can also optionally force the MCCS version of the monitor. A user supplied feature definition can, for example, specify a monitor's actual values for a Non-Continuous feature such as x60 (Input Source), or define a feature in the manufacturer supplied range xE0..XFF. The facility is enabled by option --udf . The default is currently --noudf . See page User Defined Features for details. USB By default, ddcutil no longer checks for monitors that use USB to communicate with the monitor's Virtual Control Panel . Such monitors are rare, and the error messages that occur when permissions have not been granted on /dev/usb/hiddev devices can be confusuing. USB display detection can be enabled using command line option --enable-usb . The default is --disable-usb . Command detect If no displays are found, add a message suggesting ddcutil environment Always show the product code and binary serial number Additional /sys information for --verbose output Revised logic to better handle some marginal monitor/driver cases Command capabilities The capabilities command now issues detailed error messages for malformed capabilities strings, and attempts to continue if recovery from the parsing error can produce useful information. Fixed instances of assert failures when parsing a capabilities string with unmatched parentheses or the in which the model name is unparenthesized. In the \"Commands\" segment, the id values are referred to as \"operation codes\" for consistency with DDC/CI documentaion. Capitalization in command output is more consistent. Command getvcp If getvcp does not know how to format a value, it now includes the mh, ml, sh, and sl byte values in the \"UNABLE TO FORMAT OUTPUT\" message. Implement special handling for features x62 (audio volume) x87 (audio treble), x91 (audio bass) and x93 (audio balance). In MCCS 3.0 and 2.2, these features have special reserved values along with a range of continuous values. Fix the cause of an assert failure when showing the value of feature x93 (audio balance). Command setvcp The parsing of setvcp arguments has been rewritten to correctly allow for more than 1 relative values. A command such as \"setvcp 10 +15\" was incorrectly being interpreted as indicating a relative feature value. The \"+\" or \"-\" in relative values must be surrounded by spaces. Command dumpvcp If no file name is specified on the command line, dumpvcp now writes its output to a newly created file in directory $HOME/.local/share/ddcutil. Documentation has been changed to conform to code behavior. Fixed the cause of the user name being null in the generated portion of the file name. An example of a generated file name is: DELL_P2411H-F8NDP11G119U-20201206-091307.vcp where: - DELL_P2411H is the model name reported by the EDID - F8NDP11G119U is the ASCII \"serial number\" in the EDID - 20201206-091307 is a timestamp of when the file was created Command watch Better handle fatal errors instead of continuing in an infinite loop Command environment If option --verbose is specified, the /sys file system is probed far more extensively. This change also applies to command interrogate , which incorporates environment --verbose . Option --no-x52-fifo Features x02 (new control value) and feature x52 (active control) are used together to report feature values changed using the On Screen Display (OSD). In MCCS 2.0 and 2.1, if feature x02 has the value x02 (changed controls exist) feature x52 is read once to get the id of a feature that has changed. The changed feature can be read in the usual way. Feature x02 is then read again to see if there are more features that have changed. In MCCS 3.0 and 2.2, feature X52 is supposed to be a FIFO of the ids of changed features. It is intended to be read until value x00 is returned, indicating no more features. It has been observed that at least for some v2.2 monitors (HP Z22i), feature x52 never returns x00, just always returns the same feature id. This option forces the watch command to treat all monitors as having the VCP 2.0/2.1 behavior. Option --mccs <vcp version> Option --mccs now applies to commands getvcp , setvcp , and dumpvcp in addition to vcpinfo . See documentation of the individual commands for details. Option --per-thread-stats Option ---per-thread-stats causes --stats output to include per thread statistics. By default, the --stats option does not display per thread statistics. These statistics are generally meaninful only in the shared library context, and their display is simply TMI TM . Option --enable-sleep-less Option --sleep-less , now also known as --enable-sleep-less is now the default. This eliminates some sleeps after reading DDC packets, and does not appear to affect stability. Option --disable-sleep-less restores the prior behavior. Option --edid-read-size <128|256> This option is a work-around for a problem seen with the i915 driver and docking stations. The EDID is read successfully every other time. Older EDIDs are 128 bytes in length, newer ones are 256 bytes. Strangely forcing ddcutil to read 128 bytes resolves this problem. Miscellaneous Changes and Bug Fixes Fix trace message corruption when both --thread-id ( --tid ) and --timestamp ( --ts ) are both specified. If any tracing is enabled, report the ddcutil starting and ending clock times. More functions can be individually traced using --trcfunc . Check during command parsing that functions specified by --trcfunc are in fact individually traceable. Option --nodetect is eliminated. It was reduncant since using the --bus option forces display detection to be skipped, and this is the only context in which option --nodetect was recognized. Fix the recording of the minimum and maxium maxtries values that occur in each thread. Correct --help output to indiate that \"0\" or \".\" in a --maxtries value string leaves the value of a try type unchanged. This was incorrectly documented as \".\" or \"\". For example, \"--maxtries \"., 15, 0\"\" changes only the write-read maxtries value. At startup, check that module i2c-dev is either loaded or built in. An unsupported feature is no longer regarded as a DDC data error (reported by option --ddc ). Reduce the number of error messages written to stderr instead of stdout . Bring the README.md file up to date. More definitively identify LVDS laptop displays. Building ddcutil Some configure options have been added, primarily in support of an as yet incomplete FreeBSD implementation. (Development is suspended until FreeBSD's video drivers expose the I2C bus.) Option Default Description --enable-asan no Build for execution with the Google Address Space Sanitizer. --enable-envcmds yes Controls whether commands environment and usbenvironment are included. --enable-udev yes Controls whether udev is used. --enable-targetbsd no Build for FreeBSD. Notes: - Option --disable-envcmds forces --disable-drm , and --disable-x11 - Option --enable-targetbsd forces --disable-envcmds , --disable-udev , and --disable-usb Option- -with-adl-headers has been removed. configure help messages for options that are not intended for public use are now marked \"(Developer only)\". Use of the .gitignore file has been simplified. It now identifies only files that should be ignored by any clone of the github ddcutil repository. Users should now list files specific to their copy of the repository in the file .git/info/exclude , which is not tracked. Shared Library The SONAME for libddcutil is now libddcutil.so.4. For details on changes, see Shared Library Changes for Release 1.0.0 . Acknowledgements Thank you to the many users who have not not only submitted problem reports but have helped remotely diagnose ddcutil issues. In particular: github users suuuehgi and laurisriple provided extensive help diagnosing problems with the i915 driver and docking stations. PJ Aitken has put considerable effor into reverse enginering Picture-by-Picture mode on a Phillips 499P9. github user parkerlreed helped diagnose deviations from the specification of feature x60 on an Acer ED320QR. And also a shout out to Andrey Rahmatullin who sponsors ddcutil on Debian and has help bring its packaging up to Debian standards. 0.9.9 13 June 2020 Execution Statistics Additional per-thread statistics are shown when --verbose is specified along with --stats . Statistics output has become voluminous. New group ELAPSED (alternatively TIME ) shows only the elapsed execution time. For example $ ddcutil detect --stats elapsed Statistics now seperately reports multi-part read and multi-part write tries. This reflects how statistics are implementated, allowing for Table features. As a practival matter, no monitor has ever been seen that implements features of type Table , so the multi-part write statistics will always be zero. Performance Related Command Options Option: --less-sleep , --sleep-less Eliminates many of the sleeps between the time that ddcutil receives a response packet from the display and then sends the next request packet. Depending on monitor, this can markedly improve performance, at the cost of more retries owing to increased DDC communication errors. Option --sleep-multipler still applies to the remaining sleeps. Less Useful Performace Related Command Optons The remaining new performance related options seemed like good ideas, but do not appear to significantly reduce execution time. They are included for user experimentation and feedback. They may be removed in future releases. Option: --lazy-sleep Causes some sleep events required by the DDC/CI protocol to occur in deferred mode. Instead of immediately sleeping after DDC IO events that require an interval before the next request is made of the display, the required sleep time is added to the current realtime value and saved in the associated display reference. Before the next DDC IO message to the display, the value in the display reference is checked, and if greater than the now current real time, a sleep for the remaining time occurs. Unfortunately, this option appears to have only a neglible effect on execution time. Execution statistics show an approximately 1 ms reduction in sleep time, e.g. 50 to 49 miliiseconds. This negligable effect reinforces the fact that most of ddcutil 's elapsed time is spent in DDC mandated delays and waiting for DDC IO to complete. ' Option: --dynamic-sleep-adjustment , (alternative name --dsa ) If retry is required, dynamically increases the delay time before subsequent retries, up to a maximum. Does not appear to have an appreciable effect on retry success, but it may be a useful alternative to option --sleep-multiplier . Other Options Option: --timeout-i2c-io Causes (most) I2C read and write calls to eventually time out if they do not return. This has been implemented as a POSSIBLE way to address occasional reports of ddcutil locking up, with subsequent ddcutiil calls blocking behind it. This may become the default in future releases. Support for fglrx removed ddcutil no longer supports AMD's old proprietary display driver fglrx . Command line option --adl is no longer recognized. configure option --with-adl has been removed. Miscellaneous Command ddcutil environment should have output the message \"Group i2c does not exist\" if group i2c was not found. The critical word \"not\" was missing. Thank you Micha\u00ebl Defferrard. The display identifier cross-reference table output by command ddcutil environment --verbose has been modifed to handle multiple displays with an identical EDID. Certain LG Ultrawide monitors contain neither an ASCII nor binary serial number in their EDID. Consequently, all monitors of the same model have the same EDID. Display detection now reads the EDID a byte at a time, similarly to command get-edid . This is occasionaly more reliable than the standard multi-byte read code. Thank you \"InconsolableCellist\" for pointing out this difference between ddcutil and get-edid . I2C slave address (DDC) is once again checked during display detection. This had been removed in release 0.9.3 because it caused lockups on Dell XPS 13 laptops. To address this situation, slave address x37 is not checked for laptop displays, which never support DDC. Command ddcutil detect --verbose reports the result of the x37 test. This is presently purely for informational purposes. Correctly handle multiple relative values in a single setvcp string, e.g. $ddcutil setvcp 10 + 5 12 - 3 This frankly not very useful corner case had not been taken into account when relative setvcp values were implemented. Well, now it is. ddcutil issues an error message instead of aborting if an utterly nonsensical --sleep-multiplier value greater than 100 is specified, e.g. $ ddcutil detect --sleep-multiplier 200 # WRONG Verification is always disabled if setting VCP feature xDF (Power Mode) to 5. This is a write-only value that turns off the display. Verification can never succeed. Correct the spelling of \"Finnish\" in the list of On Screen Display languages for feature xCC. Thank you Simon Alling. Tracing Trace group RETRY has been added. This subset of trace group DDCIO reports only retry activity. In a handful of unusual situations, trace messages are issued unconditionally, irrespective of the trace settings in effect. This is to highlight some rare situations, such as recovery from multiple DDC Null Messages. $ ddcutil getvcp 10 (ddc_write_read_with_retry) ddc_write_read() succeeded after 3 Null Messages If you encounter such a message, please report the circumstances in which it occurred. Building ddcutil As noted above, ddcutil no longer supports AMD's old proprietary video driver fglrx . configure option --with-adl no longer exists. Reflecting changes to how the PCI and USB hardware ID tables are packaged, ddcutil now prioritizes pci.ids and usb.ids files in directory /usr/share/misc over those in /usr/share/hwdata. Packaging requires packages pci.ids, usb.ids, and usbutils, not hwdata. Corresponding changes have been made to configuration file configure.ac . Thank you Pino Toscano. Use of include file <sys/cdefs.h> has been eliminated. This include file does not exist on Alpine Linux. Shared Library The SONAME for libddcutil is now libddcutil.so.3. For details see Shared Library Changes for Release 0.9.9 . 0.9.8 30 November 2019 Command line option --sleep-multiplier The DDC/CI specification dictates that the host computer wait 40-200 ms (depending on operation) between sending a command to the monitor and reading the response. As a result, ddcutil spends approximately 90% of its elapsed time sleeping. Many monitors respond properly with much shorter waits. On the other hand, there are some monitors that require longer waits to avoid DDC/CI errors. Option --sleep-multiplier applies a floating point multiplication factor to the DDC/CI specified sleep times. For example, --sleep-multiplier .5 causes 40 ms waits to become 20 ms, and --sleep-multiplier 4 causes 40 ms waits to beome 160 ms. Note that ddcutil may automatically increase wait times when peforming retries. Option --sleep-multiplier applies to the inital wait time. Option --sleep-multiplier can significantly speed up ddcutil execution - some monitors have been seen to operate properly with a sleep-multiplier as low as .1, Undocumented option -y for adjusting wait times is removed. Command line options --thread-id and --timestamp If option --thread-id (alternatively --tid ) is specified, trace messages are prefixed with the thread id number, e.g. [ 27044](ddc_get_nontable_vcp_value ) dh=Display_Handle[i2c: fd=3, busno=5], Reading feature 0x00 if option --timestamp (alternatively --ts ) is specified, trace messages are prefixed with the number of seconds since the start of program execution, e.g. [ 1.827](ddc_get_vcp_value ) Starting. Reading feature 0x00, dh=Display_Handle[i2c: fd=3, busno=9], dh->fd=3 If both options are specified, then both thread id and timestamp are shown. Mouse corruption during display detection When examining USB devices to determine if they support the USB Monitor Control Class Specification , it was possible to hang USB connected mice. This change peforms a pre-check to ignore mice and keyboards. It affects: - Normal ddcutil commands, e.g. ddcutil detect - The usbenvironment command - Command chkusbmon , intended for use in UDEV rules. Display Detection messages When DDC/CI communication fails during display detection and a monitor is reported as an \"Invalid Display\", if the display appears to belong to a laptop, issue a message that laptop displays do not support DDC/CI. This should reduce the incidence of people needlessly trying to diagnose a DDC/CI communication failure. Command ddcutil detect now shows a blank instead of \"unspecified\" to indicate that an EDID is not found. Miscellaneous Improve the output for feature x14 (Color Preset) to take into account the MH byte, which is defined in MCCS 3.0 and 2.2. ( Unfortunately, observed behavior on at least one MCCS 2.2 monitor, an HP Z22i, does not match the spec.) API Changes See Shared Library Changes for Release 0.9.8 for details. 0.9.7 04 September 2019 Fixes the cause of a segfault during display detection if a monitor appearing to support the USB Monitor Control Class Specification , i.e. one that uses USB to communicate monitor settings, is connected to the system. Properly handle failure when querying a feature value using USB. Plug a minor memory leak during display detection when checking if a display is an eDP device, i.e. a laptop monitor. Thank you Federico. Some debug messages still occurring in production code were disabled. Minor code cleanup to avoid warnings in Coverity static analysis. 0.9.6 25 August 2019 Command line option --nousb . This option disables the USB portion of display detection during ddcutil startup. There has been a user report that ddcutil sometimes freezes the trackpoint in a Lenovo keyboard with trackpoint (specifically Lenovo SK-8855) during display detection. The option provides a work around. Note that USB display detection is rarely required, as most monitors do not use USB to communicate settings. However, USB display detection is much, much faster than normal I2C display detection, so disabling it has a negligable effect on ddcutil execution time API Changes See API Changes in Release 0.9.6 for details. 0.9.5 24 February 2019 Feature x72 (Gamma) Added support for Virtual Control Panel feature x72 (Gamma). This is an unusual complex non-continuous feature in that its value can be changed by the user, and the parenthesized \"values\" in the capabilities string require special interpretation. The following commands have been modified: - ddcutil getvcp 72 : Interpret the output - ddcutil capabilities : Interpret the parenthesized \"values\" substring - ddcutil setvcp : See below. Command setvcp Can now take 2 byte values an an argument. Values can be specified as hexadecimal (SH byte then SL) or as decimal (0..655335). Example: ddcutil setvcp 72 x7800 Specifies SH=x78 (native gamma=2.2), SL=x00 (absolute adjustment, ideal tolerance) Thanks to YamashitaRen for pointing out the need to allow for 2 byte values and helping test the support for feature x72. Configuration and Diagnostics Contrary to existing documentation, kernel module i2c_dev is in fact required when using the proprietary Nvidia driver. Reported by Igor Ovsyanka. Kernel module documentation has been corrected, and command ddcutil environment has been updated. Bug Fixes Fix the cause of an assert failure when displaying the value of feature x8F (Audio Treble) or x91 (Audio Bass). Reported by Igor Ovsyanka. Monitor Quirks Instead of setting the \"unsupported feature\" bit in the getvcp reply packet for an unsupported feature, the Dell AW3418DW causes I2C failure with Linux errno EIO . ddcutil now interprets the EIO response as indicating an unsupported feature instead of reporting an error. This special handling currently applies only to the Dell AW3418DW. Miscellaneous Update file README.md and make it more usable as the github overview file. API Changes See API Changes in Release 0.9.5 for details. 0.9.4 25 December 2018 Fix the cause of failure to build from source for the x32 ABI . The file output by the dumpvcp command no longer contains a TIMESTAMP_MILLIS field, the number of seconds since start of the machine epoch, typically January 1, 1970. This field, and its companion TIMESTAMP_TEXT , are ignored on input, so this change can only affect an external program that relies on the TIMESTAMP_MILLIS field, say for sorting. Thank you Jan Palus, who encountered the problem when building ddcutil for the PLD Linux distribution. Fix an execution failure that resulted from attempting to open an already opened display. This occured on the capabilities command when the vcp field in the string returned by the monitor was damaaged or missing, causing ddcutil to attempt to read the VCP version from feature 0xDF. Thank you Sergiy Domin for reporting this bug. Features 0x59..0x5E (6 axis separation values). Report these values as normal continuous (C) values instead of just uninterpreted bytes. 0.9.3 26 November 2018 Display Detection Display detection no longer performs initial probes of I2C slave addresses on each possible /dev/i2c device. These initial probes do not return valid information on a Dell P2715Q, and have been seen to cause screen corruption on Dell XPS 13 laptops. In addition, /dev/i2c devices for Synopsys DesignWare are automatically skipped. Thank you Robert Munteanu for reporting and helping diagnose the P2715Q issues. Thank you Federico, developer of CLightd which uses the ddcutil API, jghauser, and especially Dr-Ongo for extensive help in reporting and diagnosing the Dell XPS 13 screen corruption. As a result of the changes to display detection, ddcutil detect --verbose no longer reports the presence of slave addresses x30 (EDID block number) or x37 (DDC), but does report whether a display is an Embedded Display Port (eDP) device, which is the case for recent laptop displays. It also reports the sysfs device name. User Supplied Feature Definitions ddcutil internals have been extensively restructured for future support of user supplied feature definitions. This will allow users to supply feature definitions for manufacturer reserved features, i.e. those in the range xe0..xff. While not yet ready for public use, there are a couple changes already visible in the user interface Command option Explanation --udef check for user supplied feature definitions --noudef do not check for user suplied feature definitions (currently the default) The following feature group has been added: Group name Explanation USER or UDF features having a user supplied feature definition Tracing Added trace groups: Name Purpose UDF user defined features DDCIO low level DDC functions VCP feature metadata Because of the volume of output, trace group \"DDC\" has been split into DDC and DDCIO, with the latter containing low level DDC services. API Changes The C API has had a few changes to support user supplied feature definitions and reflecting experience gained from work on the Qt C++ GUI interface. See API Changes in Release 9.3 for details. Miscellaneous Vebose output of the environment command now displays execution timestamps to aid in interpreting system logs. 0.9.2 01 September 2018 Command ddcutil detect Eliminate the Supports DDC: line. The output of this line reflects the result of a simple test for slave address x37 at the I2C layer. During display detection, ddcutil also attempts a real DDC exchange at the higher, DDC layer of code, and relies on this result to determine whether the monitor supports DDC. The simple x37 test is vestigial and has no effect on program logic. It also has been shown to be inadequate. It has been reported that the Dell P2715Q sometimes fails the simple x37 test even though it supports DDC. On the other hand the x37 test succeeds on a Dell U3011 when DDC is turned off in the OSD. Thank you Robert Muntreanu for the Dell P2715Q report. The result of the x37 test is still reported as part of the --verbose output of detect . Eliminate duplicate displays for DisplayPort connected monitors. Under some circumstances, a DisplayPort connected monitor is assigned two /dev/i2c devices, and detect would report two (identical) monitors. However, only one of the /dev/i2c devices supports DDC communication. This change addresses the problem for the nouveau driver, and only defines a ddcutil display for the good /dev/i2c device. Command ddcutil --help Include command scs (Save Current Settings) in the output of ddcutil --help . ddcutil scs executes a Save Current Settings operation, which is supported by some but not all DDC capable displays. This command was implemented some time ago, but was not described in the help output. Command ddcutil environment When checking for group i2c membership, issue a special message if running as root instead of the generic message that the current user is not a member of group i2c. USB connected displays Fix an invalid feature read of a USB connected display, observed when getting the controller manufacturer but VCP feature code xC8 is unsupported. When reading a USB report, regard errno EINVAL as an expected indication that no value is found rather than an unexpected status code. Tracing Fix the cause of a segfault when tracing a write-only DDC exchange (i.e. setting a VCP value) Disable debug messages regarding device id table initialization in the environment command. Eliminate double newlines in several error and trace messages Building ddcutil libusb function libusb_set_debug() is deprecated in recent libusb versions, in favor of libusb_set_option() , resulting in a compiler warning when flag -Wdeprecated-declarations is set. Calls to libusb_set_debug() in file libusb_util.c are replaced by iftested code that uses the proper function. Fix an unreachable assert() statement in file execution_stats.c that was detected by compiling with option -Werror-switch-unreachable. Thank you Jonathan Scruggs. Add \"__attribute__ ((deprecated))\" statements to functions ddca_report_active_displays() and ddca_get_feature_name_by_display() , in header file ddcutil_c_api.h . The inline documentation for these function already indicated their deprecated status. 0.9.1 27 May 2018 Bug Fix Fix the cause of an abort that may occur on command environment --verbose when examining an extremely large log file. 0.9.0 13 May 2018 Significant Command Line Changes Two enhancements will be of interest to general users: The setvcp command now allows new values for Continuous type features to be specified as relative values, e.g. the following commands increase or decrease the value of the brightness feature by 5. $ ddcutil setvcp 10 + 5 $ ddcutil setvcp 10 - 5 Note that parsing requires that \"+\" and \"-\" be surrounded by spaces. Option --no-table is now the default. Table type features are by default not included in most feature groups specified on getvcp , e.g. getvcp known . Features of type Table are rare. The DDC/CI spec does not provide a clean way for getvcp to determine that a table feature does not exist. As a result, getvcp typically has to exceed its retry count before giving up. (Exclusion of table features does not occur if a feature is explicitly specified by its hex code, or for feature groups TABLE or LUT .) The --no-table (formerly --notable ) and -show-table options explicitly control this behavior. Note that --no-table does not apply for subsets TABLE or LUT. For subsets SCAN and MANUFACTURER, the effect of --show-table / --no-table on manufacturer-specific feature codes (xe0..xff) is more complicated. ddcutil has no information about the feature characteristics of manufacturer-specific codes. Normally, it attempts only a non-table read. However, if both --verbose and --show-table are in effect, then a table read is attempted as well as a non-table read. Reporting Unsupported Features The interpretation of --show-unsupported has been tweaked. This option applies to command getvcp . (The probe command always reports unsupported features.) Command getvcp reports unsupported features if any of the following hold: - A specific feature was specified by its code, as opposed to a feature set. - Verbose output is in effect - Option --show-unsupported was specified. Option --show-unsupported is no longer automatically set for feature set ALL , which is now simply a synonym for KNOWN . Options --rw , --ro , --wo Options --rw and --ro apply to both the getvcp and vcpinfo commands. Option --wo applies only to vcpinfo . If specified, features shown are restricted to those that are read-write, read-only, or write-only. For example: $ ddcutil getvcp all --ro Option --mccs Filters the information returned by vcpinfo to that for the specified MCCS version. For example, $ ddcutil vcpinfo --mccs 2.1 Feature selection for ddcutil vcpinfo table is not properly version sensitive. -- take version from monitor selection if specified (VERIFY) -- option --mccs-version to force specific version Feature Set Identifiers Additional feature sets have been defined for the getvcp and vcpinfo commands. They surface internal ddcutil feature descriptions, and are intended to facilitate exploring the MCCS specification and its implementation on particular monitors. They will likely be of interest to only a few user. Feature Set Description SCONT Simple Continuous features CCONT Complex Continuous features CONT All Continuous features SNC NC features having a defined set of features for byte SL CNC NC features using multiple bytes NC_WO NC features that are Write NC_CONT Features of type NC that reserve specified values as flags, alloting the remaining values to a continuous range NC All Non-Continuous features MFG is now a valid synonym for feature set MANUFACTURER. Feature sets KNOWN and ALL are now synonyms. Miscellaneous The VCP file created by dumpvcp now includes a PRODUCT_CODE field including the manufacturer product code from the EDID. For some manufacturers, the model name in the EDID does not in fact distinguish among models. Notably, Samsung commonly uses just \"Syncmaster\" for the model name. Currently, loadvcp recognizes this field name but does not make use of the value. Building ddcutil Eliminate compiler flag -Wpedantic in Makefiles. This flag had been added to diagnose some obscure compiler warnings regarding system header files. It was flagging perfectly valid code as problematic, and caused build failures on Gentoo. Code changes to avoid -wformat-overflow , -wformat-truncation , and -wstringop-trunction warnings introduced with GCC 8, generally by making buffers larger. (All such warnings had flagged situations that never would result in buffer overflow.) API Changes The C API has been extensively revised reflecting experience gained from work on a Qt C++ GUI interface. See API Changes in Release 9.0 for details. Work on Python API has been suspended. Proof of concept implementations exist in the source tree for implementations using GObject API. SWIG, CFFI, and and Cython. However, these are incomplete and not intended for public use. 0.8.6 20 January 2018 The externally visible changes in this release include minor enhancements and bug fixes. There are also changes in the C API. Internally, there have been extensive changes in support of the C and (future) Python APIs. User Interface Changes Because of the design of the DDC/CI protocol, there is no certain way to distinguish a response indicating that a feature of type Table (T) is unsupported from a DDC/CI protocol error. As a result, ddcutil getvcp performs the maximum number of retries on a Table type feature before giving up. However, Table type features are rarely implemented. The new --notable option allows Table type features to be ignored, speeding up execution of getvcp commmands for multiple features. Option --notable applies if the argument to getvcp is a feature set, e.g. COLOR or KNOWN instead of a single feature id. In that case Table type features are ignored. C API changes Replace structs that use #iftests Structs DDCA_Single_Vcp_Value and DDCA_Non_Table_Value_Reponse used preprocessor #iftests for endian-ness to properly overlay the 2 byte continuous values (e.g. max value) on a pairs of 1 byte NC values (e.g. ml, mh). The use of #iftests proved incompatible with Python C function interface systems (e.g. Cython, CFFI). Struct DDCA_Single_Vcp_Value has been replaced by struct DDCA_Any_Vcp_Value . Function ddca_get_single_vcp_value() has been replaced by fuction ddca_get_any_vcp_value() , which uses DDCA_Any_Vcp_Value . Struct DDCA_Non_Table_Value_Response has been replaced by struct DDCA_Non_Table_Value . Function ddca_get_non_table_value() now returns a DDCA_Non_Table_Value , not a DDCA_Non_Table_Value_Response . DDCA_Any_Vcp_Value and DDCA_Non_Table_Value do not define 2 byte current and max values for Continuous (C) features. The 2 byte current and max values must be calculated from the appropriate pairs of single byte values, e.g. cur_val = sh << 8 | sl Eliminate use of longjmp The use of longjmp() to handle exceptional error condiitions (typically program logic errors) has been eliminated. API functions removed: ddca_register_jmp_buf() , ddca_get_global_failure_information() Structs removed: DDCA_Global_Failure_Information Miscellaneous Add trace class ENV for tracing environment related functions Internally, many functions in key portions of the code base now return exception-like structs instead of status codes. Option --excp causes ddcutil to report these exception-like structs when they are converted to status codes (and the internal detail is discarded). Bug Fixes Fix cause of a segfault in the environment command on Arch Linux due to the lack of the \"arch\" command in that distribution. Thank you Despruk. Fix a segfault when probing DRM using the environment command on aarch64. Fix a typo in the recommendations section at the end of the environment command. Thank you Mirek Svoboda 0.8.5 16 November 2017 This release contains a large number of minor enhancements and bug fixes. Most significant are those related to alternative environments, such as Raspberry Pi systems. Those running ddcutil on a 32 bit system, either i386 or Raspberry Pi, should upgrade to address a segfault in the environment command. Otherwise, there is no need to upgrade to this release unless you are experiencing problems. Changes to facilitate scripting Do not output a warning message regarding undetected VCP version if message level is --terse . \"Display not found\" message now directed to stderr instead of stdout. Packaging Changes to meet Debian distribution standards. Clean up debian/rules and other files in the debian directory. Add a changelog file, normally installed in file /usr/share/doc/ddcutil/Changelog. Rename NEWS file to NEWS.md Add configure option --enable-x11 / --disable-x11 . The default is --enable-x11 . If --disable-x11 is specified, ddcutil is built without X11 related code, which is used only for diagnostics within the environment command. Directory package has been removed from the ddcutil git tree and is no longer included in the tarball. This more cleanly separates \"downstream\" from \"upstream\" activities. Packagers for Linux distributions should contact if this creates problems. Command environment enhancements The environment command is extensively revised. The increasingly large collection of tests has been consolidated. In particular: Tests are now sensitive to machine architecture. Performs alternative tests on arm systems, inlcuding the Raspberry Pi. Added a consolidated collection of suggestions at the end that suggest ways for the user to address configuration issues. Fixed a bug that caused a segfault in 32 bit versions of ddcutil . Use of shell commands has largely been replaced with API calls, addressing some obscure shell errors. glib-2.0 The required glib-2.0 version has been increased from 2.16 to 2.32 reflecting the use of glib thread functions. Consequently, ddcutil no longer builds on some older Linux distributions. Bug fixes Fix a logic error in the VCP version comparison function vcp_version_le(). This bug affected only audio related VCP feature codes x8f, x91, and x93. It also affected experimental command watch which listens for monitor changes not made by ddcutil , i.e. by pressing buttons on the monitor. Properly handle the failure case where a display is detected on an I2C bus (EDID is read) but DDC communication fails, and the user specifies the display on the command line using the I2C bus number (option --bus ). Fix the cause of a segfault when the loadvcp command reads a user modified VCP file. The command now fails gracefully if none of MFG_ID, MODEL, and SN are present. Fix the cause of a segfault when displaying I2C functionality flags in the --environment command. This segfault was seen only in 32 bit versions of ddcutil . The --stats option showed incorrect time statistics on 32 bit versions of ddcutil . Add \"-lddcutil\" to output of \"pkgconfig ddcutil --libs\". Thank you Federico. Miscellaneous Improve reporting of the individual errors that result in command failure due to maximum I2C retries exceeded. interrogate , environment and usbenvironment now redirect all stderr output to stdout for easier capture Added command line options -trcfile and -trcfunc to enable tracing by file name and function name. Added configuration option --enable-x11 controlling whether X11 related diagnostics are included in the environment and interrogate commands, allowing ddcutil to build in embedded environments that lack X11. The default is yes . Verbose EDID decription, e.g. on command detect --verbose , now reports EDID byte 24 (x14), the supported features bitmap. This is purely informational. Ongoing work to make functions thread safe. Code cleanup. 0.8.4 22 July 2017 This release primarily contains packaging changes to meet Fedora distribution standards. It also includes minor improvements and bug fixes. There is no need to install it unless you are experiencing problems. Command ddcutil interrogate Do not include usbenvironment diagnostics as part of the interrogate command. USB connected monitors are rare and USB related diagnostics clutter the report. libddcutil-devel Do not package static libraries (.a and .la files) in libddcutil-devel. Bug fixes Prevent a segfault in monitor detection that occurrs when slave address x50 is detected on an I2C bus, but reading the EDID at that address fails. Address an assert failure in the ddcutil usbenvironment command due to an unexpected library return code. In the device identification cross reference report of ddcutil environment , properly handle I2C bus number -1, used internally to indicate unknown. 0.8.2 17 May 2017 This release introduces minor improvements to the diagnostic output of the environment , detect , and interrogate commands. There is no need to install it unless you are experiencing problems. Command ddcutil detect If a display appears to support DDC (I2C slave address x37 is active) but communication fails, perform a heuristic test as to whether it is a laptop display, issue message appropriately. Changes to reduce the number of feature reads performed when detecting monitors, slightly improving performance. Option --stats errors Maintain and report a secondary count of the individual errors that are rolled up into \"retry count exceeded\" errors. ddcutil environment --verbose changes Eliminate checks for package i2c-tools Report additional information about system hardware Add a cross reference report for the multiple ways that different subsystems identify a monitor and its I2C bus Consolidate some tests to reduce redundancy Check for DisplayPort Multi-Stream Technology (DPMST) devices Eliminate the cause of a bogus error message when scanning devices Packaging Changes to the requirements of package i2c-tools . Generally speaking, it is no longer needed for building ddcutil , and is optionally used as part of the diagnostic output of the environment command. Changed from Requires: to Suggests: for dpkg Requires: and BuildRequires: eliminated for rpm packaging in general BuildRequires: kept for SuSE rpm packaging. ddcutil needs file linux/i2c-dev.h, which is contained in package i2c-tools in SuSE releases through 13.2 Changes to packaging to conform to Debian standards Changes to packaging to conform to Fedora standards 0.8.1 06 May 2017 This is a bugfix release. There is no need to install it unless you are experiencing the segfault described below. Fixes a segfault that can occur after open() fails for a /dev/usb/hiddev device. 0.8.0 01 May 2017 Release 0.8.0 contains new features intended to address issues with particular monitors and user environments, to changes to improve performance, and code restructuring for future enhancements General Changes Monitor detection and cataloging has been extensively reworked. To support the library version of ddcutil used by the C (and future Python) APIs, the list of displays is determined at program/library initialization and saved. The processing of the DDC Null Response has changed. Normally a Null Response indicates a processing error in the monitor. Some monitors also use the Null Response to indicate that a VCP feature is unsupported. ddcutil now performs an extended sleep when receiving a Null Message response to allow the monitor to recover. It also performs an initial check of whether a monitor uses DDC Null Response to indicate unsupported features. See DDC Null Response . Linux error numbers no longer appear \"modulated\" in messages. That is, an EACCES error is reported as -13, not -1013. Note that the C API has always returned Linux error numbers in unmodulated form. General Options Option --async parallelizes the monitor checks executed during display detection. If there are multiple monitors, initial monitor checks are performed in multiple threads, improving performance. This may become the default in future releases. Option --nodetect is valid if the display is specified by its I2C bus number, using option --bus . In that case the initial detection of all displays is skipped, improving performance. This may become the default in future releases. Option --hiddev specifies a USB monitor connection by its hiddev device number. For example: --hiddev 3 refers to device /dev/usb/hiddev3. There is no single letter specifier for this option. Option --brief is now a synonym for --terse Added --stats class elapsed . --stats time is a synonym for --stats elapsed . Shows program elapsed time. Changes to Specific Commands: environment and interrogate commands: Report ddcutil version probe , interrogate , and getvcp scan commands: Do not include table features unless output level is VERBOSE. This speeds up execution as table reads for unsupported features execute the maximum number of retries. It also clarifies performance statistics. No monitors implementing table type features have yet been observed. interrogate command: Report performance statistics for individual parts of interrogate . getvcp command: If --terse output is specified, then the VCP data is output in a form that is easily machine readable. See getvcp command setvcp and loadvcp commands: By default, setvcp and loadvcp verify that a value has been successfully set by reading the value from the monitor after writing it. Option --noverify disables this check. Bug Fixes Fixed a segfault that occurred when a monitor returned a 0 length capabilities string. Variables holding nanoseconds have been changed from type long to uint64_t to address overflow problems on 32 bit systems such as Raspberry Pi. C API The C API has undergone extensive changes. Name Changes Names have been changed for consistency and clarity. Names of certain functions used in message generation have been shortened to simplify printf() type functions. Old typedef name New typedef name VCP_Feature_Code DDCA_Vcp_Feature_Code Version_Feature_Info DDCA_Version_Feature_Info Vcp_Value_Type DDCA_Vcp_Value_Type Single_Vcp_Value DDCA_Single_Vcp_Value Old function name New function name ddca_status_code_name() ddca_rc_name() ddca_status_code_desc() ddca_rc_desc() ddca_repr_display_identifier() ddca_did_repr() ddca_create_display_ref() ddca_get_display_ref() ddca_repr_display_ref() ddca_dref_repr() ddca_repr_display_handle() ddca_dh_repr() ddca_get_displays() ddca_get_display_info_list() ddca_repr_mccs_version() ddca_mccs_version_id_name() ddca_mccs_version_id_string() ddca_mccs_version_id_desc() Comments: - Function ddca_create_display_ref() was renamed to ddca_get_display_ref() to reflect the fact that it returns a DDCA_Display_Reference from the internal data structures representing detected displays.

USB bus and device numbers were removed because they are attributes by which the physical path (hiddev device) can be found, not the path itself. Struct DDCA_Display_Info has been adjusted to use DDCA_IO_Path . Function added Purpose ddca_ddcutil_version() gets version as a struct of numbers ddca_reset_stats() reset performance statistics ddca_show_stats() report performance statistics ddca_enable_verify() controls whether VCP values are read after being set ddca_is_verify_enabled() queries whether VCP values are verified ddca_free_display_info_list() free function for struct ddca_create_usb_hiddev_display_identifier() create identifier for hiddev number ddca_get_simple_nc_feature_value_name() lookup name of simple NC feature value Other Changes Functions now return Linux error number -EINVAL rather than DDC specific error number DDCL_ARG in case of invalid argument The display selection lifecycle has been changed. The DDCA_Display_Identifier is not the only way to obtain a DDCA_Display_Reference . It can be found in one of 2 ways: Function ddca_get_display_info_list() returns a collection DDCA_Display_Info , containing display identification information (e.g. ddcutil assigned display number, I2c Bus number, manufacturer id, etc.) and a display reference. The client program can search through the returned collection to find the desired monitor. A DDCA_Display_Identifier can be created and passed to ddca_get_display_ref(), which returns a DDCA_Display_Reference . See sample program demo_display_selection.c for examples. Sample code files: The following example files for using the C API have been added: File name Purpose demo_global_settings.c Report and modify global settings demo_display_selection.c Display selection demo_vcpinfo.c Query VCP feature code descriptons demo_get_set_vcp.c Get and set VCP values File clmain.c is now a miscellaneous catchall, mainly for testing. Build system changes src/Makefile.am: change dist-hook to use -prune option per Knut Omang; avoids eror in case there is nothing to erase (i.e. build hasn't happened) Added cmake file FindDDCUtil.cmake from Dorian Vogel 0.7.3 05 March 2017 Maintenance release. Add additional diagnostic tests to command ddcutil environment --verbose *. New configure option --enable-drm . If enabled (the default), command ddcutil environment --verbose includes additional tests that use DRM services to better analyze disrepancies observed in the field between the EDID read directly from the monitor and that reported by X11. Option --enable-drm requires that a recent version (>= 2.4.67) of the development package for libdrm2 (libdrm-dev or libdrm-devel depending on Linux distribution) be installed when building ddcutil . If a sufficently recent version is not detected, configure issues a warning and reverts to --disable-drm . If minimizing executable size is important, set --disable-drm , as DRM services are used only for diagnostics. Additional information on ddcutil detect --verbose . Report and interpret USB vendor id/product id when detect cannot open a hiddev device. This is usually benign, and identifying the device should make this evident. Suggest that the user check that DDC/CI is enabled in the monitor's on screen display if I2C bus x37 (DDC) is responsive, but DDC communication fails. 0.7.2 01 February 2017 Maintenance release. Fixes a critical bug in release 0.7.1 where insufficient privileges on a /dev/i2c-n device causes program termination. ddcutil interrogate always executes with --set-slave-address in effect Minor improvements to ddcutil environment and ddcutil interrogate output Minor improvements to ddcutil detect --verbose Add explanations for additional errno values 0.7.1 27 January 2017 Mantenance release. Add option --force-slave-address which causes ddcutil to take control of slave addresses on the I2C bus even if they are in use. Internally, ioctl(I2C_FORCE_SLAVE) is called instead of ioctl(I2C_SLAVE) . This is intended as a possible workaround for situations where monitors on an I2C bus are not detected. See Option --force-slave-address Option --force disables various checking. It's use is likely to result in command failure, but may provide useful information as to the source of problems. See Option --force Fix the cause of a segfault when displaying statistics for option --stats errors or simply --stats , or on the interrogate command. make install will not install C header files unless configuration option --enable-lib is set. Fix the cause of a Makefile error when trying to strip dependency information from libddctuil.la during make install . Extensive rework of Autotools files for future support of Python 3 as well as Python 2. This work is incomplete. Emit diagnostic messages to aid in debugging certain situations seen only in the field. 0.7.0 03 January 2017 C API Should be fairly stable, though not all features of ddcutil are exposed. Reflecting the presence of APIs, the default for the --enable-lib configuration option is now \"yes\". The following shared object library is created: libddcutil.so Additional prebuilt packages: libddcutil0, libddcutil-dev (Debian, Ubuntu) or ddcutil-devel (Fedora, SUSE) Python API The Python API, implemented using SWIG, is a rough proof of concept and subject to major change. SWIG support is only available by building from source, not from pre-built packages. Requires --enable-swig configuration option. A new command line option --mfg , which allows for monitor selection using the 3 character manufacturer id found in the EDID. --model and -sn no longer need to specified together. If any of --mfg , -model , and -sn are specified, the first monitor to match all of the manufacturer/model/serial-numbers that are specified is chosen. The monitor feature and capabilities portion of interrogate has been enhanced. This functionality is also exposed using the new probe command which operates on a single monitor. Parsing of the capabilities string is enhanced to accomodate monitors that do not separate feature codes by blanks. 0.6.1 21 November 2016 Maintenance release. Improve recovery and diagnotistic messages for certain exceptional conditions. Command ddcutil interrogate now reports the differences between VCP codes declared in the capabilities string and those observed by scanning. Extensive internal changes in preparation for future C and Python APIs. 0.6.0 01 October 2016 Rename project from ddctool to ddcutil. Primary executable is now named ddcutil Shared library is now named libddcutil.so Tarball is now named ddcutil.n.n.n.tar.gz 0.5.3 24 September 2016 Fix overzealous code cleanup in release 0.5.1. Undefined reference to function is_module_loaded_using_sysfs() when building without ADL support. Error in command parsing. Command arguments were ignored. 0.5.1 23 September 2016 Minor improvements to diagnostics of the environment and interrogate commands: Check if i2c_dev is built into the kernel as an alternative to it being a loadable kernel module Recognize amdgpu video driver 0.5 09 September 2016 This is the first formal release of ddcutil Rework USB monitor support based on testing with Eizo Coloredge and NEC PA series -- Probing of USB connected monitors is greatly extended and refactored from ddcutil environment into a separate command ddcutil usbenv . Libraries hidraw and libusb are used as well as hiddev. HID Report Descriptors are parsed. This probing is included in ddcutil interrogate . -- configure option --enable-usb/--disable-usb controls whether ddcutil is built with USB monitor support. The default is --enable-usb . When building with USB support, packages for udev, hidraw, hiddev, and libusb are required. Simplify README.md. Refer to www.ddcutil.com for most documentation The assumption that I2C buses are numbered consecutively is removed. Required for Raspberry Pi. Allow a display to be specified on the command ddcutil loadvcp . This addresses the situation where a monitor presents both an I2C and a USB interface. Normally, the display is determined using the data stored in the VCP file, and the I2C display interface is chosen over the USB interface. If a display is specified, then the model and sn from its EDID must match those in the VCP data being loaded. Add ddcutil command option --timestamp/--ts . If specified, trace messages are prefaced with an elapsed timestamp. Because of changing package requirements, ddcutil no longer builds in the openSUSE Build Service (OBS) for older OS versions (openSUSE 13.1, Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04). ddcutil currently does not build for any openSUSE version in the openSUSE Build Service due to violation of policy guidelines. This problem will be addressed in a subsequent release. openSUSE users can build ddcutil from its tarball.","title":"Release Notes"},{"location":"release_notes/#release-notes","text":"For ddcui changes, see ddcui Release Notes","title":"Release Notes"},{"location":"release_notes/#214","text":"17 Feb 2024 Restored API function ddca_create_display_ref() .

For devices using DDC/CI (i.e. all but the few that communicate the with the monitor's Virtual Control Panel using USB), there are roughly speaking two phases to this process. First, every /dev/i2c device associated with a video display adapter is examined to determine if it has an EDID, i.e. if it is associated with a connected monitor. After that, each of the /dev/i2c devices associated with monitors are tested to see if DDC/CI communication works for the /dev/i2c device. This includes a check that the monitor adheres to the DDC/CI specification for reporting unsupported features; if not, ddcutil attempts to figure out if there is some other way the monitor reports unsupported features. To speed up this process, the following changes have been made. - Option ***--ddc-check-async-min*** specifies a threshold number for performing the DDC related checks in parallel. The optimal value is a tradeoff between the time savings from parellel execution and the overhead of splitting execution into multiple threads. This tradeoff will vary by processor speed and the number of threads available. The default value is 3, i.e. parallelize execution if 3 or more monitors are present. - The ambiguously named ***--async*** option has been is deprecated and now has no effect. Previously, it turned on parallel execution of DDC related checks in a multi-monitor situation, no matter the number of monitors. - As a practical matter, once you know that your display adheres to the DDC/CI spec, there's no need to perform the DDC level check every time **ddcutil** is invoked.

Most commonly, this is seen with displays connected to docking stations. For several years now, all docking station connected displays, even those using HDMI or DVI connections, internally rely on a DisplayPort MST connection between the computer and the docking station. The kernel changes were made in the Direct Rendering Mode (DRM) subsytem. The Intel i915 and AMD amdgpu drivers, which are implemented as part of DRM, have been tested and (mostly) work. Other drivers part of the kernel DRM component, e.g. nouveau, should also work but have not been tested. Nvidia's proprietary driver uses it own proprietary DRM implementation and still does not support DDC communication over MST. Unfortunately there are problems with the DRM code, which ddcutil can only sometimes work around. Sometimes the display's EDID cannot be read on I2C slave address x50. As a result, ddcutil does not report the existence of a display connected to the /dev/i2c device. ddcutil attempts to work around this by trying to read the EDID multiple times with both 128 and 256 block sizes. Depending on the monitor, usually one or the other will work, but sometimes neither do. Option --edid-read-size , which was introduced in release 1.0.1, can force the block size to 128 or 256. This problem can be unrecoverable when the computer suspends and resumes, requiring reboot. On the other hand, the same monitor may appear as two different /dev/i2c devices, only one of which supports DDC. Curiously EDID read failures are associated with the /dev/i2c device that supports DDC. ddcutil attempts to detect which /dev/i2c device should be used for monitor communication, and the detect command reports the other as a \"Phantom Display\" instead of an \"Invalid Display\".

Option: --lazy-sleep Causes some sleep events required by the DDC/CI protocol to occur in deferred mode. Instead of immediately sleeping after DDC IO events that require an interval before the next request is made of the display, the required sleep time is added to the current realtime value and saved in the associated display reference. Before the next DDC IO message to the display, the value in the display reference is checked, and if greater than the now current real time, a sleep for the remaining time occurs. Unfortunately, this option appears to have only a neglible effect on execution time. Execution statistics show an approximately 1 ms reduction in sleep time, e.g. 50 to 49 miliiseconds.

Certain LG Ultrawide monitors contain neither an ASCII nor binary serial number in their EDID. Consequently, all monitors of the same model have the same EDID.

The DDC/CI spec does not provide a clean way for getvcp to determine that a table feature does not exist. As a result, getvcp typically has to exceed its retry count before giving up. (Exclusion of table features does not occur if a feature is explicitly specified by its hex code, or for feature groups TABLE or LUT .) The --no-table (formerly --notable ) and -show-table options explicitly control this behavior. Note that --no-table does not apply for subsets TABLE or LUT. For subsets SCAN and MANUFACTURER, the effect of --show-table / --no-table on manufacturer-specific feature codes (xe0..xff) is more complicated. ddcutil has no information about the feature characteristics of manufacturer-specific codes.

It is desiabled by option --disable-udf (alt. --noudef ). The default is --enable-udf . The user defined features for a monitor are specified in a feature definition file. The format of this file is subject to change. User Defined Feature File Here's an example of a file that specifies user defined features. $ cat ~/.local/share/ddcutil/DEL-DELL_U2222-16485.mccs MFG_ID DEL MODEL DELL U2222 PRODUCT_CODE 16485 MCCS_VERSION 2.2 FEATURE_CODE FD Feature Name ATTRS NC RW VALUE 0 First Val VALUE 0X01 Second Val 0x VALUE X02 Third value X VALUE 03H H at end FEATURE_CODE xFB Another Feature ATTRS C RO FEATURE_CODE 0xfa a feature with code staring with 0x ATTRS C RO The first 3 lines identify the monitor model, using a 3 character manufacturer id, the model name, and the integer product number, as given in the EDID, and reported by the detect command. The feature definition applies to any monitor that matches those identifiers. Model name and product number are both required because some manufacturers use generic model names, and many set the product number to 0. For example, Samsung commonly uses the name \"SyncMaster\", and LG commonly uses the name \"LG ULTRAWIDE\". The optional MCCS_VERSION line specifies the version of the MCCS Specification used to describe the monitor. If specified, it is used instead of the value returned by querying VCP feature xDF (VCP Version). If the MCCS version is also specified using the --mccs command line option, the command line option takes precedence. In addition to the monitor identification lines and optional MCCS version line, there are one or more feature definitions. Each defnition starts with a line of the form FEATURE_CODE <feature-id> <feature name> . Feature codes are implicitly hex numbers, and can be written with or without a leading \"x\". The ATTRS line contains feature attributes: \"C\" or \"NC\" indicating whether the feature is continuous or non-continuous, and \"RW\", \"RO\", or \"WO\" indicating whether the feature is read-write, read-only, or write-only. For non-continuous features, there are one or more VALUE lines describing the possible values. Each line has the form: VALUE <value> <description> . Feature values can be written either as decimal or hexadecimal. By default, the value is interpreted as decimal. If the value is explicitly hex, e.g. with a leading \"x\", it is interpreted as a hex value. So value string \"x11\" represents decimal 17, while \"11\" represents decimal 11. This can be a source of confusion, as command capabilities reports hex values without a leading \"x\". The MCCS specification has evolved to include features that don't neatly conform the original Continuous/Non-Continuous classification. For example, continous features can have special reserved values, and non-continuous features exist that do not have simple tables of feature values, but instead have unique interpretations. The User Defined Feature facility cannot define such features. Blank lines and lines beginning with \"*\" or \"#\" are ignored.

AOC Q2775 VCP Version: 2.2 Controller Manufacturer: Mstar Controller Model: mh=0xff, ml=0x16, sh=0x00 Firmware version: 0.7 Manufacture year: 2016 Feature x0B: Color temperature increment: 100 deg Kelvin Feature x0C: Color temperature request: 100 Caclculated color temperature = 3000 + 100 * 100 = 3000+10000 = 13000 deg Kelvin (nonsensical) Capabilities string has controller manufacturer name in model() field. Apple Cinema Display A1082 Has both I2C and USB interfaces. VCP Version: 2.0 Controller Manufacturer: unspecified Controller Model: unspecified Firmware version: unspecified Manufacture year: 2005 I2C interface has more VCP features than USB interface. USB interface does not report VCP version (feature DF). Able to read EDID over USB. Capabilities string does not begin and end with parentheses. Asus MG279 The capabilities string is malformed. Asus PG329Q VCP version 2.2 Controller Manufacturer: Novatek Firmware version: 0.36 Manufacture year: 2020 The EDID contains neither an ASCII nor a binary serial number. Asus ROG PG279Q VCP version: 2.2 Controller Manufacturer: manufacturer defined controller Controller Model: Firmware version: 5.57, 5.59 Maufacture year: 2017, 2018 Does not support VCP codes x0B and X0C. Does not support feature x60 - Input Source Does not respond to getvcp of unsupported VCP codes by setting the unsupported feature flag in the GETVCP response. Requests for unsupported features return garbage bytes, the requests fail by exceeding retries. The output of the capabilities command does appear to accurately report which features are supported. Asus VE247 VCP version: 2.0 Controller Manufacturer: RealTek Controller Model: mh=x00, ml=x24, sh=x82 Firmware version: 2.0 Maufacture year: 2010 Responds to unknown VCP codes using the DDC NULL message instead of setting the Unsupported VCP code bit in the GETVCP response. Sensible responses to VCP codes x0B and x0C. Asus VS248 The value of feature x60 (Input Source) can be changed only from the currently active input. BenQ GW2480 VCP Version: 2.1 Controller Manufacturer: Mstar Controller Model: mh=0x00, ml=0x58, sh=0x00 Firmware version: 3.10 Manufacture year: 2018 Color temperature increment (x0b) = 50 degrees Kelvin Color temperature request (x0c) = 70 Requested color temperature = (3000 deg Kelvin) + 70 * (50 degrees Kelvin) = 6500 degrees Kelvin Brightness and possibly other color related features are disabled when Dynamic Contrast Range (DCR) is enabled (using OSD). BenQ XL2411Z VCP version: 2.2 Controller Manufacturer: Mstar Controller Model: mh=x00 mh=x00, ml-x85, sh=x56 Firmware version: 2.1 Manufacture year: 2013 Feature x0B: Color temperature increment: 50 deg Kelvin Feature x0C: Color temperature request: 0 Caclculated color temperature = 3000 + (0*50) = 3000 deg Kelvin (nonsensical) Responds to VCP feature x60 (Input Source) even though this is not documented in the capabilities string.

The unsupported feature bit is not set. Reading any other unsupported feature value results in an IOCTL failure with Linux errno=EIO (5). Dell P2411 VCP version: 2.1 Controller Manufacturer: Mstar Controller Model: mh=x00, ml=x00, sh=x56 Firmware version: 1.1 Manufacture year: 2011 Lots of I2C errors. Heavily dependant on retries. The CAPABILITIES command sometimes fails, even with maximum retries. More recently, works with nouveau driver, but fails with proprietary Nvidia driver. Reports VCP code 0B (color temperature increment) as 1 degree Kelvin, which makes the GETVCP response to VCP code 0C (color temperature request) nonsensical. Dell P2715Q VCP version: 2.1 Controller Manufacturer: Mstar (sl=x05) Controller Model: mh=x00, ml=x00,x sh=x56 Firmware version: 2.1 Manufacture year: 2015 Feature x0B, Color temperature increment: unsupported Feature x0C, Color temperature request: unsupported very clean, no DDC retries needed Dell S3422DWG VCP version: 2.1 Controller Manufacturer: RealTek (sl=0x09) Controller Model: mh=0x00, ml=0x27, sh=0x17 Firmware version: 65.3 Manufacture year: 2021 Github user Noctivans has posted extensive notes detailing what he discovered on how to control Picture In Picture/Picture By Picture using undocumented features. Dell Ultrasharp 1905FP Does not support DDC. Dell Ultrasharp U2413 VCP version: 2.1 Controller Manufacturer: STMicroelectronics (sl=x0d) Controller Model: mh=x00, ml=x93, sh=x01 Firmware version: 2.1 Manufacture year: 2013 This monitor has a hardware LUT, however LUT loading not supported using standard VCP feature codes. Responds to VCP feature xc0 (Display Usage Time), but returns 0. Color temperature: color temp increment (feature 0B): unsupported color temp request (feature 0C): unsupported Dell 2407wfp VCP version: 2.0 Controller Manufacturer: Genesis Controller Model: mh=0xff, ml=0xff, sh=0x4a Firmware version: 29.1 Cannot set brightness less than 30. setvcp values in the range 0..50 are mapped to the range 30..50 User eskampie created the following table.

Attempting to set feature x12 (contrast) less than 25 results in a value of 25. However, it is possible to set a lower contrast value in the OSD . Unlike the Dell 2404wfp feature x10 (brightness) can be set to any value between 0..100. Clean implementation, no I2c retries required. Dell U3011 VCP version: 2.1 Controller manufacturer: Mstar Controller Model: mh=x00, ml=x94, sh=x85 Firmware version: 1.5 Manufacture year: 2012 If a value is set using SETVCP, the new value takes effect and may appear in the on-screen display. However, GETVCP (or the verification option) sometimes still retieves the old value, not the new one. More specifically: Feature Name Code Notes Contrast x12 values below x25 take effect but the old value is returned Video Gain: Red x16 Values below 100 take effect, but the GETVCP reports 100 Video Gain: Green x18 Ditto Video Gain: Blue x1a Ditto Display Mode xdc Reports VCP code x0B (color temperature increment) as 1 degree Kelvin, which makes the GETVCP response to VCP code x0C (color temperature request) nonsensical. Color temperature: color temp increment (feature 0B): 1 deg K color temp request (feature 0C): 2 calculated color temp = 3000 + (x0c_val * x0b_val) = 3000 + (1 * 2) = 3002 degrees Kelvin Dell Ultrasharp U3415W VCP version: 2.1 Controller manufacturer: Realtek (sl=x09) Controller Model: mh=x00, ml=x11, sh=x11 Firmware version: 65.1 Manufacture year: 2015 Neither feature 0B (color temperature increment) or 0C (color temperature request) are listed in the capabilities string.

Eizo Coloredge CG19 VCP version: unreported Controller manufacturer and model: unreported (VCP feature code C8 unsupported) Firmware version: unreported (VCP feature code C9 unsupported) Reports EDID at I2C bus address x50. Does not support DDC over I2C (bus address x37). Does implement MCCS over USB, and appears to conform to the USB Monitor Control Class Specification. However, it appears that the more sophisticated monitor features such as LUT loading use manufacturer specific USB HID reports. Unable to read EDID over USB, even though the HID Report for EDID can be located. To set color related VCP feature values, Custom Color mode must be selected. If set to sRGB or Calibrated, the SETVCP command will appear to succeed, but will have no effect. (In sRGB mode, Brightness can be set, in Calibrated mode it cannot.) Eizo EV2785 Reports EDID ad I2c bus address x.50. Does not support DDC/CI (bus address x37). Uses USB for monitor control, but uses manufacturer-defined usage pages for communication, i.e. does not support the USB Monitor Control Class Specification . Electriq 244MKHDR VCP version: 2.2 Controller manufacturer and model: Realtek 0.1 Firmware version: 0.1 This is a marketer rebrand of a monitor created by some Chinese company, possibly Meirun. The 3 character manufacturer id \"WAM\" is not registered. The serial number reported is \"demoset-1\", The values reported by the monitor for features x10 (brightness) and x12 (contrast) are not those shown in the OSD. For details, see ddcutil issue 200: Electriq 24 inch monitor - brightness works but getvcp range doesn't match OSD range . Feature x60 (input source) reports invalid value x00 as the current input. Feature xCA (OSD/Button Control) reports that the OSD is disabled, even though it is enabled. Gateway Diamondtron VX920 VCP version: Unspecified, implies 1.0 Controller manufacturer and model: Unknown (VCP feature code C8 unsupported) Firmware version: Unknown (VCP feature code C9 unsupported) Hanns G Hi221D VCP version: 2.1 Controller manufacturer: Mstar Controller model: mh=x00, ml=x92, sh=x00 Firmware version: 0.6 All GETVCP requests return a value, whether or not the feature is valid for the monitor. The monitor never reports a feature as unsupported. HP LP1965 VCP version: 2.0 Controller manufacturer: Undocumented value: x64 Controller model: mh=xff, ml=xff, sh=x86 Firmware version: 0.3 Manufacture year: 2007 Capabilities reports non-standard DDC command x4E. Color temperature: color temp increment (feature 0B): 50 deg K color temp request (feature 0C): 70 calculated color temp = 3000 + (x0c_val * x0b_val) = 3000 + (70 * 50) = 6500 degrees Kelvin HP LP2475w VCP version: 2.1 Controller manufacturer: Genesis Controller model: mh=xff ml=xff sh=x80 Firmware version: 0.31 Manufacture year: 2008 Color temperature: color temp increment (feature 0B): 3000 deg K color temp request (feature 0C): 1 calculated color temp = 3000 + (x0c_val * x0b_val) = 3000 + (1 * 3000) = 6000 degrees Kelvin LUT loading not supported using standard VCP feature codes. Implements MCCS over USB as well as I2C. However, the USB implementation appears to be non-standard. It does not conform to the USB Monitor Control Class Specification. HP LP2480zx VCP version: 2.1 Controller manufacturer: Genesis Controller Model: mh=xff, ml=xff, sh=x80 Firmware version: 0.139 Manufacture year: 2008 Heavily reliant on manufacturer specific VCP codes. Most color related features, including loading the internal LUT, are not supported using standard VCP feature codes. Implements MCCS over USB as well as I2C. However, the USB implementation appears to be non-standard. It does not conform to the USB Monitor Control Class Specification. Sensible reponses to VCP codes 0B and 0C. Capabilities string does not match actual capabilities observed. For example, capaibilites does not include VCP feature code x10, brightness, which is recognized by getvcp and setvcp. Values in capabilities string for feature 60 is a mixture of hex and decimal values, i.e. 01 02 03 04 05 07 0C 13 14 15 17 1C Should be: 01 02 03 04 05 07 0C 0D 0E 0F 11 ?? Capabilities string does include cmds() segment listing supported commands, or model() segment listing model. HP w2207 VCP Version: 2.1 Controller manufacturer: Mstar Firmware Version: 3.5 Manufacture year: 2007 Color temperature increment (feature x0B) and request (feature x0C) result in a color temperature of 13,000 degress Kelvin Responds with data to all VCP feature requests, never reports a feature as unsupported HP ZR2740w VCP version: 2.2 Implements only a few VCP codes. VCP feature codes 0B and 0C unsupported. HP Z27n G2 VCP version: 2.2 For VCP code 60 (input source), the second DisplayPort input is value 0x13, instead of the standard 0x10. 0x13 is reported accurately as the value to use in capabilities. When using VCP code 60 to switch inputs, the value read by GetVCP only updates once the new source has a valid input signal. Until there is a valid signal, GetVCP continues to report the previously selected input. Iiyama PL2492H VCP Version: 2.2 (reported by capabilities string), 2.1 (reported by feature xdf) Controller Manufacturer: Connexant Firmware version: 0.0 Manufacture year: 2017 Color temperature increment (feature X0B): 100 degrees Kelvin Color temperature request (feature X0C): results in a nonsensical color temperature 1300 (3000 + 100 * 100) degrees Kelvin Requires that a Save Current Settings packet (command scs ) be sent immediately after a Set VCP Feature packet (command setvcp ) to actually set the value. Never sets the unsupported feature bit in a VCP Feature Reply packet (command getvcp ). The capabilities command must be checked to determine if a feature is supported. Iiyama PL2779Q VCP Version: 2.1 Controller manufacturer: unknown (feature code xC8 unsupported) Firmware version: unknown (feature code xC9 unsupported) Manufacture year: 2013 Color temperature increment (feature x0B) and request (feature x0C) result in a color temperature of 26,100 degress Kelvin Does not include command x02 (VCP Response) or xE3 (Capabilities Reply) in its capabilities string, even though these are supported. Responds to several VCP feature not listed in capabilities. Iiyama PL2792Q VCP Version: 2.2 (reported by capabilities string), 2.1 (reported by feature xdf) Controller Manufacturer: RealTek (controller number mh=x00, ml=x27, sh=x85) Firmware version: 0.0 Manufacture year: 2020 Color temperature increment (feature X0B): 100 degrees Kelvin Color temperature request (feature X0C): results in a nonsensical color temperature of 1300 degrees Kelvin Requires that a Save Current Settings packet (command scs ) be sent immediately after a Set VCP Feature packet (command setvcp ) to actually set the value. Never sets the unsupported feature bit in a VCP Feature Reply packet (command getvcp ). The capabilities command must be checked to determine if a feature is supported. Lenovo ThinkVision X1 VCP Version: 2.1 Controller manufactuer: Mstar Controller Model: mh=0xff, ml=0x16, sh=0x00 Firmware level 1.0 Manufacture year: 2016 Color temperature: - color temperature increment (feature 0B): 100 deg Kelvin - color temperature request (feature 0C): 35 - calculated color temperature: 3000 + (x0c_val * x0b_val) = 3000 + (35 * 100) = 6500 degrees Kelvin Brightness (feature x10) cannot be changed when Dynamic Contrast Range (DCR) is enabled (using OSD). Per user Janusz Kowalczyk, setting Dynamic Constrast Range and/or Low Blue light in the OSD disables various features in the OSD. Presumably they cannot be changed by ddcutil either. Brightness and Contrast may or may not be disabled Color related settings may or may not be disabled Image scaling is disabled DisplayPort version selection is disabled Lenovo L22e-20 VCP Version: 2.0 Controller Manufacturer: Mstar Controller Model: mh=0x00, ml=0x00, sh=0x00 Firmware level 1.0 Manuracture year: 2019 EDID has no serial number. Color temperature: - color temperature increment (x0B): 100 degrees Kelvin - color temperature request: (x0C) 0 - calculated color temperature = 3000 + (0 * 100) = 3000 degrees Kelvin Brightness and possibly other color related features are disabled when Dynamic Contrast Range (DCR) is enabled (using OSD). LG 22MP48D-P VCP Version: 2.1 Manufacture year: 2016 Controller manufacturer and model: MStar Firmware version: 5.0 Features x0B and x0C are supported. Calculated color temperature = 6500 degrees Kelvin. EDID model name is generic \"LG IPS FULLHD\" Never sets the Unsupported Feature bit in replying to a GETVCP request for an unsupported feature. Instead retuns a success response with all response bytes = 0. LG 23EA73 Never sets the Unsupported Feature bit in replying to a GETVCP request for an unsupported feature. Instead retuns a success response with all response bytes = 0. LG 27MU67 VCP Version: 2.1 Manufacture year: 2015 Controller manufacturer: Mstar Controller model: mh=x00, ml=xff, sh=x00 Firmware version: 3.7 Features X0B and X0C are not supported. Cannot calculate color temperature. No serial number in EDID. When brightness (VCP feature x10) is changed, it reverts to the original value after approximately 1 second. The same behavior is seen on Windows using ClickMonitorDDC and softMCCS, so this is clearly a monitor issue. This problem is not observed for other features. LG 27MD5KL UltraFine VCP Version: 2.2 (from the capabilities string) Manufacture year: 2020 Controller manufacturer: unknown (feature xc8 unsupported) Controller version: unknown (feature xc8 unsupported) Firmware version: 3.4 The EDID model name is generic \"LG UltraFine\". This 5K monitor appears to have been built with only Macs in mind. It has no buttons, and no on screen display (OSD). Despite an extensive list of features in the capabilities string, getvcp for most returns with the unsupported feature bit set in the response packet. The only features in the capabilities string that can be read using getvcp are: 0x10 (brightness), xFD (manufacturer reserved), xFF (manufacturer reserved). In particular, getvcp of feature xDF (VCP version) fails. Per the MCCS specification, this feature must be supported as of MCCS 2.0. The following features unknown to MCCS are not listed in the capabilities string, but return a value for getvcp : xD1, xD3, xD5, xDD This monitor also supports USB access to the Virtual Display Panel, but the only feature supported through this interface is 0x10 (brightness). LG 29UM69G VCP Version: 2.1 Manufacture year: 2019 Controller manufacturer: RealTek controller number: mh=0x00, ml=0xff, sh=0x00 Firmware version: 3.24 EDID version: 1.3 EDID model name is \"LG Ultrawide\". No ASCII \"serial number\". (Binary serial number not checked) Malformed capabilities string. (The \"cmds\" segment is named \"UM69cmds\") Values ( parsed): 0f: DisplayPort-1 10: DisplayPort-2 11: HDMI-1 Has 1 HDMI, 1 DisplayPort, 1 USB-C Alt DP Users report that it does not support DDC on the DisplayPort input. (See issue LG 29UM69G fails switching input ) on github. Github user mbastian resported: After more than four months of back and forth with German support I've got this: Our Korean software development takes note of reports of this kind, but this does not lead to customer feedback. Wwe do not see any need for further action here. At first they where denying that DDC was even supported, when I've pointed them to the manual and spec sheet then they insisted that it only applied to the OSD. Finally they escalated it. I've explained in detail what my problem is, asked if there is a firmware update or an undocumented ddc feature.... and all I got is a not very nice \"Don't bother us again!\" And Github user AndyKassell reported this response from LG tech support: We have had a response from our Technical Team and they have advised that our monitors do not support DDC-CI officially. Some models are able to issue some commands such as brightness, contrast etc, but if there are issues with this, it would not be considered a fault as it is not guaranteed to work. I apologise for any frustration this causes. LG 27BN88U 27UL850 27GN950-B 29UM69G 34Wk500-P 34WN80C-B 34UM88P 38WN95C Users of all these recent LG displays report similar problems with VCP feature X60 (Input Source). getvcp 60 always returns x00, which is not a valid value. setvcp 60 flashes the screen, sometimes opens the OSD, never sets the value LG 27UD88 29UMS7P Users report this monitors do support featrue x60 LG HDR 4K No model name string in EDID. The binary model number is set (x7702 = 30471) No ASCII serial number in EDID. Binary serial number is present VCP version: 2.1 Controller manufacturer: MStar (sl=x05) Controller Model: mh=x0, ml=xff, sh=x00 Firmware version: 3.4 Manufacture year: 2019 Properly sets the Unsupport VCP Code bit in a GETVCP response. LG Ultrawide VCP version: 2.1 Controller manufacturer and model: STK Firmware version: 0.1 Manufacture year: 2014 Feature codes are not separated by blanks in the vcp() section of the capabilities string. No serial number in the EDID. When responding to a Get VCP Feature request, the monitor never sets sets the Result Code field of the VCP Feature Reply to Unsupported VCP Code. Instead, it always reports No Error. For unsupported VCP codes, all bytes in the response (MH, ML, SH, SL) are set to x00. Mitsubishi RDT232WLM VCP Version: 2.1 Controller manufacturer and model: unreported (VCP feature code C8 unsupported) Firmware version: unreported (VCP feature code C9 unsupported) Manufacture year: 2010 DDC/CI communication works for DVI connector. Does not work on HDMI connector. DDC/CI communication requires signficant number of retries, and occasionaly fails because of the maximum number of retries is exceeded. Features x0B and X0C are not listed in the capabilities string. The monitor replies to getvcp requests for these features. The response to feature X0B (color temperature increment) is 50 degrees Kelvin, which is reasonable. The response to feature X0C (number of color temperature increments) is 0, resulting in a temperature of 3000 degrees Kelvin, which is nonsensical. Responds to getvcp for feature xA8, which is not defined in the MCCS specification. Monoprice Dark Matter 40776 VCP Version: 2.1 Controller manufacturer: Mstar Controller model: mh=x00, ml=xff, sh=x56 Firmware version: 0.0 Manufacture year: 2020 This monitor has 2 HDMI inputs and 2 DisplayPort inputs. The capabilities string reports that VCP feature x60 takes the values x11, x12, x0f, and x10, which per the MCCS spec are HDMI-1, HDMI-2, DisplayPort-1 and DisplayPort-2 respectively. However the actual values, which are reported by getvcp and settable by setvcp are: x05 - HDMI-1 x06 - HDMI-2 x07 - DisplayPort-1 x08 - DisplayPort-2 A new input source can only be set when ddcutil setvcp 60 is issued from the current input source. It is also the case that getvcp and other queries only work when issued on the current input source. The ASCII \"serial number\" in the EDID is blank, and the binary serial number is 0. Consequently, 2 monitors manufactured at the same time will have identical EDIDs, which will confuse software that depends on the EDID to uniquely identify a display. NEC LCD3090WQXi VCP Version 2.0 Controller manufacturer and model: unreported (VCP feature code C8 unsupported) Firmware version: unreported (VCP feature code C9 unsupported) Manufactur year: 2012 Color temperature increment: x0B 100 degress kelvin Color temperature request 35 -> 3000 + 35*100 = 6500 NEC P241W VCP Version 2.0 Controller manufacturer and model: unreported (VCP feature code C8 unsupported) Firmware version: unreported (VCP feature code C9 unsupported) The capabilities string has 2 additional sets of features, designated vcp_p02 and vcp_p10, in addition to the set specified in the vcp() field. It also reports the commands xC2, xC4, xC6 and xC8, which are not part of the DDC/CI specification. Likely these commands are feature request/response pairs for vcp_p02 and vcp_p10. Does not use the usual VCP codes (e.g. x16/Red Gain) for color control. Instead uses the 6 axis color control features x8c..xa0. Has an internal hardware LUT, but it is not accessed using the MCCS defined features for LUT mannipulation. Uses a proprietary USB for communication, which does not support adhere to the USB Monitor Control Class Specification . NEC PA241 VCP Version 2.0 Controller manufacturer and model: unreported (VCP feature code C8 unsupported) Firmware version: unreported (VCP feature code C9 unsupported) Implements both I2C and USB interfaces. Makes heavy use of manufacturer specific VCP feature codes. Also, ddcutil capabilities --verbose reports numerous manufacturer specific DDC commands The USB interface also makes heavy use of manufacturer specific usage codes. Monitor must be set to ??? to allow changes. VCP code x0c (Color Temperature Request) returns 0, which is nonsensical. Does not use the usual VCP codes (e.g. x16/Red Gain) for color control. Instead uses the 6 axis color control features x8c..xa0. Phillips 328P6VU VCP Version: 2.2 (capabilities string) VCP Version: 3.0 (feature xDF) Controller manufacturer: Mstar (sl=0x05), controller number: mh=0xff, ml=0x16, sh=0x00 Firmware version: 0.0 Manufacture year: 2019 The EDID contains a binary serial number, but does not contain an ASCII \"serial number\". VCP code 0x0b (Color temperature increment ): 100 degree(s) Kelvin When VCP code 0x14 (Select color preset) = User 1 (0x0b): VCP code 0x0c (Color temperature request ): 3000 + 35 * (feature 0B color temp increment) degree(s) Kelvin -> 6500 degrees Kelvin This is sensible. Feature xDF (VCP Version) incorrectly reports that the VCP version is 3.0. Problems with feature x60 (Input Source): - In MCCS version 3.0, feature x60 (Input Source) is of type Table, not Non-Continuous.

In both cases they were using the amdgpu video driver This was true no matter which DisplayPort version was chosen in the OSD. As of 12/2020, this is not fixed by the most recent monitor firmware update. User razamatan reports that he was told in Samsung's chat support that DDC/CI is not implemented on DisplayPort. The capabilites string reports an unrecognized command code, x4e Feature x14 (Color Perset), x06 (Color Temperature Increament) and x06 (Color temperature requrest) appear consistent.

No matter what the color mode (x14 Preset, xDC Display Mode) color settings (x16, x18, x1a) cannot be changed. Brightness (x10) and contrast can be changed only in some modes. Values in the capabilities string correlate poorly with observed values. For example, according to the capaiblities string, feature x60 (Input source) has values x11, x12, and x0f, which the MCCS spec defines as HDMI-1, HDMI-2 and DisplayPort-1 respectively. However, the observed values are x05, x06, and x0f, which the MCCS spec defines as Composite video 1, Composite video 2, and Displayport respectively.

I apologise for any frustration this causes.","title":"LG 29UM69G"},{"location":"archived/monitor_notes/#lg-27bn88u-27ul850-27gn950-b-29um69g-34wk500-p-34wn80c-b-34um88p-38wn95c","text":"Users of all these recent LG displays report similar problems with VCP feature X60 (Input Source). getvcp 60 always returns x00, which is not a valid value. setvcp 60 flashes the screen, sometimes opens the OSD, never sets the value","title":"LG 27BN88U 27UL850 27GN950-B 29UM69G 34Wk500-P 34WN80C-B 34UM88P 38WN95C"},{"location":"archived/monitor_notes/#lg-27ud88-29ums7p","text":"Users report this monitors do support featrue x60","title":"LG 27UD88 29UMS7P"},{"location":"archived/monitor_notes/#lg-hdr-4k","text":"No model name string in EDID.
