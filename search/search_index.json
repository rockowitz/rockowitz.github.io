In particular: The shared library name is now libddcutil.so.4.1.0. Improved tracing. For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prior announcements can be found here . Introduction ddcutil is a Linux program for managing monitor settings, such as brightness, color levels, and input source. Generally speaking, any setting that can be changed by pressing buttons on the monitor can be modified by ddcutil . ddcutil primarily uses DDC/CI (Display Data Channel Command Interface) to communicate with monitors implementing MCCS (Monitor Control Command Set) over I2C. Normally, the video driver for the monitor exposes the I2C channel as devices named /dev/i2c-n. Alternatively, there is support for monitors (such as Eizo ColorEdge displays) that implement MCCS using a USB connection. See USB Connected Monitors . A particular use case for ddcutil , and the one that inspired its development, is as part of color profile management. Monitor calibration is relative to the monitor color settings currently in effect, e.g. red gain. ddcutil allows color related settings to be saved at the time a monitor is calibrated, and then restored when the calibration is applied. Restrictions: ddcutil does not support laptop displays, which are controlled using a special API, not I2C. Generally speaking, ddcutil can be built in a virtual machine, but will not run in a VM. This is because the virtual video drivers do not implement I2C. However, if the VM is connected to a separate video card and is running a non-virtualized driver for the card in passthru mode, then ddcutil will work. Nvidia's proprietary video driver may require special configuration. See Special Nvidia Driver Settings . Reading and writing Table type features is implemented but untested.

DDC/CI is layered on top of that protocol, describing particular sequences of bytes that are communicated between a master device (the host computer) and a slave device (a monitor) at address x37 on an I2C bus. By analogy, DDC is as a subclass of superclass I2C, that is DDC obeys the rules of I2C, but is more specific. For example, only certain byte sequences are legal. SMBUS is another protocol based on I2C. ddcutil reads from and writes to the userspace /dev-i2c * devices which present a file system like abstraction of an I2C bus. It leaves the bit-banging to the video device drivers, e.g. amdgpu, nouveau. One source of confusion in DDC documentation is the specification of slave adddresses on the I2C bus. Sometimes you'll see the DDC address documented as x37, other times as the pair x6e/x6f. Leaving aside the implementation of 10 bit I2C bus addresses (uncommon), I2C slave addresses are encoded in a single byte. The high order 7 bits are used for the address per se. The low order bit is 0 for a write operation, 1 for a read operation. Much of the VESA documenation regards the entire 8 bit value as an address, which means address x37 becomes the pair x6e/x6f. Similarly, the 7 bit address for the EDID is x50; regarded as an 8 bit address, the EDID address becomes xA0/xA1. ddcutil specifies I2C slave addresses in 7 bit form, as do utilities such as i2cdetect , i2cget , and i2cset .

Setting --disable-usb reduces size and package requirements. (Default is --enable-usb.) --enable-drm yes Build with DRM support, used for enhanced diagnostics. Setting --disable-drm reduces size and package requirements. (Default is --enable-drm.) --enable-lib yes Build the shared library. (Default is --enable-lib.) --enable-x11 yes Build using X11 services, used for enhanced diagnostics. Setting --disable-x11 allows for use on systems lacking X11.

Ultimately, you'll have to try to build ddcutil and see what breaks. ddcutil requires the following packages for both building and execution: i2c-tools glib-2.0 (Note: glib-2.0 can be packaged with different names, e.g. libglib2.0-0, and may entail installing multiple packages.) Minimum version: 2.32 libgudev (e.g. libgudev1) libusb-1.0 (e.g. libusb-1.0-0) Minimum version 1.0.15 libudev (e.g. libudev1) libdrm2 Minimum version: 2.4.16 libxrandr2 hwdata On most platforms, development related files (e.g. headers files) are in separate packages having a \"-dev\" or similar suffix in their names. ddcutil needs development packages for: libc6 (e.g. libc6-dev) glib2.0 (e.g. libglib2.0-0) libusb (e.g. libusb-1_0-devel, libusb-1.0-0-dev) python (e.g. python-all-dev) udev or systemd (udev may be part of systemd, e.g. libudev-devel, libudev-dev) x11 (e.g. libx11-dev) xrandr (e.g. libxrandr-dev) libdrm2 (e.g. libdrm-devel) On older versions of Ubuntu, the i2c.h header file is found in a separate package. If the following package exists, it is required to build ddcutil. libi2c-dev However, as of libi2c 4.0, i2c.h is no longer part of this package. Error messages from configure regarding missing packages can be misleading. If configure complains that a package is not found but it seems to be installed, it's likely that the associated development package (with a suffix like \"-dev\") needs to be installed. Building requires that the core build files be installed (e.g. the files listed in build-essential on Ubuntu) and also the pkg-config system. pkg-config Building from git The git repository for ddcutil is here Building ddcutil from git requires that the autotools related packages be installed. The exact packages vary from distribution to distribution. On Ubuntu, these include: autoconf, Minimum version: 2.50 automake, Minimum version: 1.13 autotools-dev libtool m4 To configure the build, change to the main ddcutil directory and execute the file: # ./autogen.sh Or issue the individual commands: # aclocal # autoconf # automake Then to configure, build, and install ddcutil : # ./configure # make # sudo make install Shared library configuration By default, command \" sudo make install \" installs the shared library files ( libddcutil.so.n.n and symbolic links) in directory /usr/local/lib. In order to be available, command ldconfig must be run and it must find the shared library file. \" sudo make install \" automatically calls ldconfig after installing the library. For ldconfig to find the file, directory /usr/local/lib should be in a file in /etc/ld.so.conf.d. This is the case in Ubuntu. For further details, see: Shared Library Configuration Common issues: If you see a message \"required file './ltmain.sh.' not found\", run libtoolize (See https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Error-required-file-ltmain_002esh-not-found.html) May get the following warning when running automake src/Makefile.am:38: warning: compiling 'cmdline/cmd_parser_aux.c' in subdir requires 'AM_PROG_CC_C_O' in 'configure.ac' This is an autotools versioning issue.

New header files: File Name Contents ddcutil_macros.h Macros to specify the ddcutil version at compile time ddcutil_status_codes.h Status codes defined by ddcutil Multithreading There is rudiementary support for multi-threaded use of the API. Considerations: It is safe to perform simultaneous operations on separate displays (using distinct display handles) on separate threads. Multiple simultaneous DDC operations on the same display will have unpredictable results. Do not open multiple handles for the same display. The ddcutil API prevents opening multiple handles for devices with the same DDCA_IO_Path, which blocks the most common case. However, it is conceivable that the same monitor might be connected in multiple ways (e.g. with both a DDC and USB connection), with multiple cards, or even from separate computers. In this case it is the application's or even user's responsibility to ensure that conflict does not occur. The following settings are now thread specific: whether setvcp verification is enabled ( ddca_enable_verify() , ddca_is_verify_enabled() ) output redirection ( ddca_set_fout() , etc.) output level ( ddca_set_output_level() , ddca_get_output_level() ) Presently, multi-threaded operation is best managed in the application. The C++ Qt based GUI currently under development does the following: - Calls ddca_get_display_info_list() to enumerate the displays - Opens the display (i.e. creates a DDCA_Display_Handle ) - Maintains a queue of requests - Calls the ddcutil API for each request, and updates the GUI accordingly Library Build Information No changes.

MCCS Version Identification To date, the API has had two different ways to specify the Monitor Control Command Set (MCCS) version: - DDCA_MCCS_Version_Spec , a pair of 8 bit unsigned integers. - DDCA_MCCS_Version_Id , an enum of valid MCCS versions. Going forward, the API will use DDCA_MCCS_Version_Spec . Existing functions using DDCA_MCCS_Version_Id are retained, but are marked as deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Once the deprecated functions are removed, there will likely be some simplification of the remaining function names. Symbolic constants DDCA_VSPEC_V10 etc. have been added for DDCA_MCCS_Version_Spec values.

DDCA_MCCS_Version_Spec was chosen because it is the form already used in the MCCS spec. DDCA_MCCS_Version_Spec - Feature code xDF (get MCCS version) returns a number pair - The capabilities string specifies the MCCS version as a number pair DDCA_MCCS_Version_Id - There are only a handful of valid version numbers - Simplifies version specification - Simplifies version comparisons, which are complicated by the fact that both Version 3.0 and Version 2.2 are independent successors to Version 2.1.

Miscellaneous changes: - Bitfield DDCA_Version_Feature_Flags now has bit DDCA_NC_COMPLEX , indicating a VCP code (designated by MCCS as Non-Continuous) that uses certain values as an NC feature and uses the remaining range for continyous adjustment. An example of such a feature is VCP code x62 (Audio Speaker Volume) as defined in MCCS versions 3.0 and 2.2, where value x00 is defined as \"Fixed (default level)\", value xFF is \"Mute\", and values x01..xFE provide a continuous range for volume adjustment.

General changes: - The names of report functions that display internal data structures for debugging, as opposed to reports designed to be shown to users, now begin with \"ddca_dbgrpt_\" instead of \"ddca_report_\". - Enum values DDCA_V10 etc. are now DDCA_MCCS_V10 etc. (but note that the use of DDCA_MCCS_Version_Id is deprecated in favor of DDCA_MCCS_Version_Spec ) - Names of parameters that specify the address at which a pointer is to be returned now generally end in \"_loc\". Specific changes not listed elsewhere: Old Name New Name DDCA_IO_DEVI2C DDCA_IO_I2C Naming patterns: - Functions that always return the same value generally do not include \" _get_ \" in their names, e.g. ddca_ddcutil_version() , ddca_max_max_tries() - In the case of \"overloaded\" functions, \" _by_ \" is usually used to distinguish variants, e.g. ddca_get_feature_metadata_by_vspec() , ddca_get_feature_metadata_by_dref() , get_feature_metadata_by_display() - However, in the case where there the result depends on a single input value from which the result is extracted, \" _from_ \" is used, e.g. ddca_mmk_from_dref() , ddca_mmk_from_dh() Get and Set VCP Feature Values DDCA_Any_Vcp_Value vs DDCA_Non_Table_Vcp_Value The API provides functions for getting, setting, and otherwise processing VCP values in 3 forms, using the type specific DDCA_Non_Table_Vcp_Value or DDCA_Table_Vcp_Value or the more general DDCA_Any_Vcp_Value . The first form is simpler to use, and does not entail the allocation of arbitrarily size buffers. As a practical matter, while the MCCS spec defines Table type features, they have not been observed on any monitors. Supporting Table type features in a UI adds complexity. API users will probably want to use the simpler DDCA_Non_Table_Vcp_Value functions. The following tables summarize the structs and API functions for getting and setting VCP feature values.

How best to deal with them? Multiple design principles apply here. Unfortunately, they conflict: - Libraries should not crash - Programming errors should cause immediate and spectacular failure - Client programs should not have to test for return codes that reflect programming errors. This clutters the code. Java addresses this conundrum through the use of RuntimeExceptions, such as NullPointerException and IllegalArgumentException, which need not be caught, or can be caught at the top level of a program. Unfortunately, C doesn't provide such an elegant solution. Until now, many precondition tests have been done using assert() statements. This is not a long term solution, since assert()s can be disabled when programs are built for production. Other precondition failures have resulted in a return code of DDCRC_ARG . As a first step, the assert() statements and other precondition tests have been unified with a common set of macros. This at least provides more consistent behavior, and will facilitate future changes. For now, a precondition failure results in a message to stderr and a return code of DDCRC_ARG . In the future, this may change to a message followed by library abort. Or the behavior may be controlled by the client using an API call to select the desired behavior. Comments on this design issue are invited. Notes on Freeing Resources ddca_free_ functions fall into two groups, those that specify client side data structures and are referenced by a normal pointer, and those that specify internal library data structures and are referenced by an opaque pointer. Those that specify client side data structures are essentially convenience functions, relieving the client programmer of the details of freeing what may be a complex data structure. These functions always return void. If passed a NULL pointer, they do nothing. Functions that free client data structures ddca_free_error_detail() ddca_free_display_info_list() ddca_free_parsed_capabilities() ddca_free_table_vcp_value() ddca_free_any_vcp_value() ddca_free_feature_metadata() Functions that free internal library data structures take an opaque pointer as an argument. These functions return a DDCA_Status . They return DDCRC_ARG if the pointer is invalid. If the pointer is NULL, the function does nothing and DDCRC_OK is returned. Depending on the function, additional status codes are possible. Whether or not memory is actually freed is a hidden implementation detail, as some opaque pointers reference persistent internal data structures. Functions that free internal library data structures ddca_free_display_identifier() ddca_close_display() Additional Notes: If a function that creates a resource (e.g. ddca_create_busno_display_identifier() ) returns other than DDCRC_OK (0), then the resource is not created and need not be freed. In general, the order in which the ddca_free_ functions are called does not matter. The ddca_free_ functions are not idempotent. Attempting to free an already freed opaque resource will likely return DDCA_ARG , but may result in a segfault. Attempting to free an already freed client side resource will also likely result in a segfault.

Functions that free client data structures ddca_free_error_detail() ddca_free_display_info_list() ddca_free_parsed_capabilities() ddca_free_table_vcp_value() ddca_free_any_vcp_value() ddca_free_feature_metadata() Functions that free internal library data structures take an opaque pointer as an argument. These functions return a DDCA_Status . They return DDCRC_ARG if the pointer is invalid. If the pointer is NULL, the function does nothing and DDCRC_OK is returned. Depending on the function, additional status codes are possible. Whether or not memory is actually freed is a hidden implementation detail, as some opaque pointers reference persistent internal data structures. Functions that free internal library data structures ddca_free_display_identifier() ddca_close_display() Additional Notes: If a function that creates a resource (e.g. ddca_create_busno_display_identifier() ) returns other than DDCRC_OK (0), then the resource is not created and need not be freed. In general, the order in which the ddca_free_ functions are called does not matter. The ddca_free_ functions are not idempotent. Attempting to free an already freed opaque resource will likely return DDCA_ARG , but may result in a segfault. Attempting to free an already freed client side resource will also likely result in a segfault.","title":"Notes on Freeing Resources"},{"location":"c_api_95/#newly-deprecated-functions","text":"API function ddca_get_formatted_vcp_value() is marked as deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

This string describes, among other things, the VCP Features that the monitor supports and, for non-continuous features where appropriate, the allowed values. Unfortunately, the capabilities string is unreliable. Therefore ddcutil simply presents the string. It does not use the capabilities string when formulating commands and interpeting responses. The capabilities string is unreliable for several reasons: The response to the DDC capabilities request may simply be incorrect. For example, the capabilities response from the HP LP2480zx monitor does not list VCP feature code x10 (brightness) as supported. However, feature code x10 is in fact supported. The only way to know for sure if a monitor implememts a VCP feature code is to try it. A DDC capabilities request requires multiple I2C exchanges, making it both slow and unreliable. Because of its complexity, it is particularly vulnerable to I2C errors. On monitors with paticularly poor I2C implementations it sometimes fails because the maximum number of I2C retries is exceeded. There is no capabilities request defined in the programming interface for USB connected monitors. ddcutil simulates a capabilities response by looking at what USB HID reports exist for feature codes. Note however, that ddcui does make use of the the capabilities string. By default the capabilities command displays the capabilities string in parsed form.

The capabilities string is unreliable for several reasons: The response to the DDC capabilities request may simply be incorrect. For example, the capabilities response from the HP LP2480zx monitor does not list VCP feature code x10 (brightness) as supported. However, feature code x10 is in fact supported. The only way to know for sure if a monitor implememts a VCP feature code is to try it. A DDC capabilities request requires multiple I2C exchanges, making it both slow and unreliable. Because of its complexity, it is particularly vulnerable to I2C errors. On monitors with paticularly poor I2C implementations it sometimes fails because the maximum number of I2C retries is exceeded. There is no capabilities request defined in the programming interface for USB connected monitors. ddcutil simulates a capabilities response by looking at what USB HID reports exist for feature codes. Note however, that ddcui does make use of the the capabilities string. By default the capabilities command displays the capabilities string in parsed form. Option: --terse Display the unparsed capabilities string. Option: --verbose Display both the unparsed string and its parsed form.","title":"Command capabilities"},{"location":"command_detail/","text":"Command Detail Primary Commands detect getvcp setvcp vcpinfo dumpvcp & loadvcp scs Secondary Commands environment usbenvironment probe interrogate chkusbmon Options Display Selection Options Feature Selection Options Performance Other","title":"Command Detail"},{"location":"command_detail/#command-detail","text":"Primary Commands detect getvcp setvcp vcpinfo dumpvcp & loadvcp scs Secondary Commands environment usbenvironment probe interrogate chkusbmon Options Display Selection Options Feature Selection Options Performance Other","title":"Command Detail"},{"location":"command_detect/","text":"Command detect Syntax: detect <options> Scans the system for displays supporting the Monitor Control Command Set (MCCS), most commonly using DDC/CI but alternatively using USB for communication.

For most monitors that support DDC/CI, whether DDC/CI comminication is actually enabled is controlled by a setting in the on screen display. The item is typically found in a submenu named something like \"Other Settings\" Video Driver The video driver must support I2C bus communication. All major open source drivers (nouveau, radeon, admdgpu, i915) support I2C bus communication, as does the Nvidia proprietary driver. If using Nvidia's proprietary video driver, special settings may be necessary. See Special Nvidia Driver Settings For the Rapberry Pi, see the section Raspberry Pi . Ensure that the /dev/i2c-N devices exist Typically, the I2C buses are exposed as devices named /dev/i2c-N. Kernel module i2c-dev must be loaded to create the /dev/i2c-N devices. See Kernel Module Configuration Grant read/write permission for the /dev/i2c-N devices representing monitors ddcutil users require read/write permission to /dev/i2c-N devices. With varying complexity, this can be effected in several ways. Run ddcutil as root. Grant everyone RW access to the /dev/i2c devices. Add a file with the following line to /etc/udev/rules.d SUBSYSTEM==\"i2c-dev\",KERNEL==\"i2c-[0-9]*\", MODE=\"0666\" If /dev/i2c-N devices are already assigned to group i2c, add users to that group. This is the case, for example, if package i2c-tools has been installed on a Debian derived distribution (e.g. Ubuntu). In that case, file /lib/udev/rules/60-i2c-tools.rules is installed. Add the users who will run ddcutil to that group. usermod -G i2c -a <yourname> Create group i2c to manage access. The most general case entails creating group i2c, creating a UDEV rule assigning /dev/i2c-N devices to group i2c, and adding users to group i2c.

The widget for these features has both a slider/spinbox for the continuous range, and a combo-box for the special values. Non-Continuous Feature Values There are three interrelated mechanisms for addressing unexpected values for a simple Non-Continuous feature. The monitor may report feature value that is not listed in the capabilities string or the Monitor Control Command Set. In this situation that value is still listed in the combo box even if another value is subsequently selected. When presenting simple Non-Continuous feature, ddcui uses the values/name table specified for the monitor's MCCS version. Sometimes monitors use feature values defined in a later version. The Use latest MCCS values checkbox in the NC Feature Values dialog specifies that the NC value table for the highest possible MCCS version be used. This can also be specified by command line option --force-latest-nc_value-names . Supply a User Defined Feature definition. See User Defined Features . Redetect Monitors For situations where a display is attached or detached, Menubar option Actions->Redetect Monitors can be used to redetect displays.

Occasionally the converse is true. This section describes how DDC, or more precisely I2C, is communicated over DisplayPort, and may prove helpful when analyzing DDC communication problems. I2C is a simple serial protocol that uses 2 signaling lines, referred to as SCL and SDA, sometimes referred to as DDC clock and DDC data, along with their associated grounds. These are pins 12/15 on a HD15 VGA connector, 6/7 on a DVI connector, and 15/16 on a HDMI connector. DVI and HDMI use the same protocol, TDMS (Transition Minimized Differential Signaling) for transmitting video information. While more recent versions of HDMI have additional capabilities, e.g. Ethernet, CEC, for video and DDC of monitor communication DVI and HDMI are equivalent, except for bandwidth. It's possible to connect a DVI output on a host to a HDMI input on a monitor, or vice-versa, using a simple DVI<->HDMI cable. DisplayPort, on ther other hand, uses its own protocol for video. It also has a secondary Auxilliary (AUX) channel (and pins) for non-video communication. DisplayPort does not have the I2C SLA/SLC pins. Instead, the logical I2C signals are converted at each end into messages on the AUX channel. Put another way, DDC is implemented using the AUX channel, but the AUX channel itself is not DDC. The \"multiplexing\" of I2C over the AUX channel is transparent to all but the lowest level of I2C software at each end. In is possible to connect the DisplayPort output on a host to a DVI or HDMI input on a monitor using an \"active\", or sometimes a \"passive\", adapter. Most active adapters connect a DisplayPort output on the host to a DVI or HDMI input on the monitor. An active adapter converts the DisplayPort video signal to the TDMS video signal used by DVI or HDMI. It also converts the I2C signals on the AUX channel to and from the physical SDA and SCL signals on the DVI/HDMI connector. To the host, it appears that it is communicating with a DisplayPort input on the monitor. To the monitor it appears that it is communicating with a HDMI or DVI output on the host. There are active adapters that convert a DVI/HDMI output on the host to a DisplayPort input on the monitor. These adapters are uncommon, and are much more expensive. There do not appear to be any adapters that operate in both directions. Active adapters will be labeled \"Active\". If the video adapter implements Display Port Dual Mode, also known as DP++, then it is possible to use a \"passive adapter\" between the DisplayPort output on the host and the HDMI/DVI input on the monitor. When the host detects that its DisplayPort output is connected to a HDMI/DVI monitor input instead of a DisplayPort input, it shifts to \"alternate\" mode, treating its DisplayPort connector as if it were a weird DVI/HDMI connector. It uses TDMS for the video signal, and uses the AUX channel pins as simple SDA/SCL pins. A \"passive\" adapter simply routes wires appropriately, and adjusts voltage levels. Host DisplayPort connectors that support dual mode should be marked as such. The marker is a D with a P inside, and two + signs to the left, one above the other. Most DisplayPort connectors on recent video cards are dual mode. Unfortunately, they are not always marked as such. Thunderbolt ports, which use the DisplayPort protocol for video signaling, support DP++ natively. Note that here may be limitations on the number of DisplayPort outputs can operate in alternate mode. In that case, active adapters are required.

Laptop displays do not support DDC/CI. ddcutil can't communicate with a monitor when it's plugged into a docking station. ddcutil does work when the monitor is plugged directly into the laptop. The problem affects DisplayPort, DVI, and HDMI connectors on the dock. This is a problem with newer docking stations that implement DisplayPort Multi Stream Transport. The drm driver layer does not implement I2C writes. For the gory details, see this thread on the Intel-gfx developers list. A fix for this problem has been developed. It is merged into kernel release 5.11. I'm using Nvidia's proprietary driver. ddcutil doesn't seem to be be working. Symptoms include \"DDC communication failed\" on ddcutil detect , and lots of \"Maximum retries exceeded\" errors on command ddcutil getvcp known . You may need the Nvidia secret handshake. See Special Nvidia Driver Settings . The capabilities command reports the MCCS (aka VCP) version, but elsewhere ddcutil says the version is unknown. DDC/CI has two ways to get the the MCCS version: As part of the capabilities string returned in response to a DDC Capabilities Request. As the response to a VCP Feature Request for feature xDF (VCP Version). Sometimes they disagree. Command ddcutil capabilities reports the response to the DDC Capabilities Request. However, ddcutil regards this output as purely informational. (See capabilities command ) ddcutil therefore relies on VCP feature code xDF to determine the VCP version. (For USB connected monitors, it queries HID usage x00800004.) It is possible that feature code xDF is unsupported, even though the capabilities response specifies a version. The output of the capabilities command is incorrect. For example, a Dell P2210 monitor has VGA, DVI, and DisplayPort inputs, but capabilities only reports: Feature: 60 (Input Source) Values (unparsed): 01 03 Values ( parsed): 01: VGA-1 03: DVI-1 The capabilities string reported by a monitor is often incorrect. While the ddcutil capabilities command parses and reports the string, this is solely informational. The only way to know for sure if a monitor supports a VCP Feature Code is by testing using the getvcp and setvcp commands. The following command will attempt to read all VCP codes that ddcutil understands, other than those that are write-only: ddcutil getvcp known To attempt to read all possible VCP codes, whether understood by ddcutil or not, except for those that are known to be write-only: ddcutil getvcp scan To see all the values defined for a non-continuous (NC) feature code, i.e. one with discrete values, use the vcpinfo command with the --verbose option. For example, to see all the values defined in the Monitor Control Command Specification for VCP feature x60 (Input Source): # ddcutil vcpinfo 60 --verbose VCP code 60: Input Source Selects active video source MCCS versions: 2.0, 2.1, 3.0, 2.2 MCCS specification groups: Miscellaneous ddcutil feature subsets: Attributes (v2.0): Read Write, Non-Continuous (simple) Attributes (v2.1): Read Write, Non-Continuous (simple) Attributes (v3.0): Read Write, Table (normal) Attributes (v2.2): Read Write, Non-Continuous (simple) Simple NC values: 0x01: VGA-1 0x02: VGA-2 0x03: DVI-1 0x04: DVI-2 0x05: Composite video 1 0x06: Composite video 2 0x07: S-Video-1 0x08: S-Video-2 0x09: Tuner-1 0x0a: Tuner-2 0x0b: Tuner-3 0x0c: Component video (YPrPb/YCrCb) 1 0x0d: Component video (YPrPb/YCrCb) 2 0x0e: Component video (YPrPb/YCrCb) 3 0x0f: DisplayPort-1 0x10: DisplayPort-2 0x11: HDMI-1 0x12: HDMI-2 In practice, any given monitor will implement only a few of the NC values, and some monitors will implement undocumented values. The only way to know for sure is by testing. ddcutil detect --verbose reports that both I2C address x50 (EDID) and x37 (DDC) are responsive, but DDC communication fails. There can be any number of reasons for this situation. Check that DDC/CI communication is enabled in the monitor's on-screen display? It has been observed in the case of a Tegra video card using the nouveau driver. See also the discussions of duplicate entries for a DisplayPort monitor , and of failures with newer docking stations . The same DisplayPort connected monitor appears twice in the output of ddcutil detect . Sometimes the same DisplayPort connected monitor is detected at 2 different I2C bus numbers. ddcutil detect reads the EDID at on both buses, but typically DDC communication succeeds on only 1 bus. ddcutil attempts to filter out the invalid bus. The invalid bus appears to be related to the DisplayPort multistream facility. You can ignore the invalid entry. The detect command reports different EDIDs depending on how the monitor is connected to the video card. Strange as it may seem at first, a monitor can have more than one EDID. The EDID for a VGA connection will have a different video input definition (byte x14) than that for a digital connection. The VGA version of the EDID will have timing information. The detect command reports that I2C bus address x30 (EDID block number) is inactive. EDID version 1.4 allows for addtional 128 byte EDID blocks. I2C bus address x30 specifies which block to read. These blocks generally contain extended timing information. ddcutil is interested only in the contents of the first EDID block. The check of bus address x30 is purely informational. Recent laptops use Embedded Display Port (eDP) panels which have an I2C interface. Why doesn't ddcutil work? The I2C connection on eDP panels implements slave address x50, which allows programs to read the EDID in the expected way. However, it does not implement slave address x37, i.e. it does not support DDC/CI. If eDP panels did implement DDC/CI, ddcutil would support it. For each I2C bus that could possibly be associated with a monitor, as part of display detection ddcutil attempts to read the EDID at slave address x50. If successful, it then attempts to communicate on slave address x37. If that fails, and display detection is occurring in the context of ddcutil detect --verbose , ddcutil then looks for a possible reason, and checks to see if the display is a laptop. If so, it then reports that laptops to not support DDC/CI. ddcutil does not work on a Raspberry Pi 4 The HDMI related chip has been changed on the Raspberry Pi 4, and drivers have not yet been revised to enable userspace access to /dev/i2c-2. For details, see page Raspberry Pi . setvcp does not change the feature value Several Iilyama monitor models require that command scs (Save Current Settings) be issued immediately after a feature value is set. setvcp must be invoked with the --noverify option, followed immediately by scs . The monitor supports Dynamic Contrast Range (DCR). setvcp for feature x10 (brightness) does not change the value At least some monitors with Dynamic Contrast Range (DCR) disable feature x10 (brightness) and possibly other features when DCR is enabled. This has been reported with both Lenovo and Benq monitors. The new value for feature x10 is different from the value specified on setvcp It is common for the new value of a Continuous feature to be off by 1 from the specified value. This appears to be the result of integer to floating point to integer conversion in the monitor. At least one monitor (Dell 2407wfp) does not allow setting brightness less than 30. setvcp values in the range 0..50 are mapped to to 30..50. ddcutil hangs on Radeon RX 5xxx and 6xxx cards (Navi and Navi2 GPU) There have been multiple reports of ddcutil command failures on Radeon cards with the Navi and Navi2 GPUs (RX 5xxx and RX 6xxx cards). In some cases ddcutil hangs. (See for example issues Stop poking AMDGPU SMU I2C #194 , Screen freeze when changing brightness #223 ).. The SMU related hang should have been fixed as of kernel 5.14.4. ddcutil has had a workaround since release 1.1.0. In other cases, the monitor's EDID is simply not detected. If your kernel version is 5.14.4 or later, I suggest you file a bug report at the amd driver issue list .

Unable to read EDID over USB, even though the HID Report for EDID can be located. To set color related VCP feature values, Custom Color mode must be selected. If set to sRGB or Calibrated, the SETVCP command will appear to succeed, but will have no effect. (In sRGB mode, Brightness can be set, in Calibrated mode it cannot.)

Lenovo ThinkVision X1 VCP Version: 2.1 Controller manufactuer: Mstar Controller Model: mh=0xff, ml=0x16, sh=0x00 Firmware level 1.0 Manufacture year: 2016 Color temperature: - color temperature increment (feature 0B): 100 deg Kelvin - color temperature request (feature 0C): 35 - calculated color temperature: 3000 + (x0c_val * x0b_val) = 3000 + (35 * 100) = 6500 degrees Kelvin Brightness (feature x10) cannot be changed when Dynamic Contrast Range (DCR) is enabled (using OSD). Per user Janusz Kowalczyk, setting Dynamic Constrast Range and/or Low Blue light in the OSD disables various features in the OSD. Presumably they cannot be changed by ddcutil either. Brightness and Contrast may or may not be disabled Color related settings may or may not be disabled Image scaling is disabled DisplayPort version selection is disabled Lenovo L22e-20 VCP Version: 2.0 Controller Manufacturer: Mstar Controller Model: mh=0x00, ml=0x00, sh=0x00 Firmware level 1.0 Manuracture year: 2019 EDID has no serial number. Color temperature: - color temperature increment (x0B): 100 degrees Kelvin - color temperature request: (x0C) 0 - calculated color temperature = 3000 + (0 * 100) = 3000 degrees Kelvin Brightness and possibly other color related features are disabled when Dynamic Contrast Range (DCR) is enabled (using OSD). LG 22MP48D-P VCP Version: 2.1 Manufacture year: 2016 Controller manufacturer and model: MStar Firmware version: 5.0 Features x0B and x0C are supported. Calculated color temperature = 6500 degrees Kelvin. EDID model name is generic \"LG IPS FULLHD\" Never sets the Unsupported Feature bit in replying to a GETVCP request for an unsupported feature.

LG 27MU67 VCP Version: 2.1 Manufacture year: 2015 Controller manufacturer: Mstar Controller model: mh=x00, ml=xff, sh=x00 Firmware version: 3.7 Features X0B and X0C are not supported. Cannot calculate color temperature. No serial number in EDID. When brightness (VCP feature x10) is changed, it reverts to the original value after approximately 1 second. The same behavior is seen on Windows using ClickMonitorDDC and softMCCS, so this is clearly a monitor issue. This problem is not observed for other features. LG 27MD5KL UltraFine VCP Version: 2.2 (from the capabilities string) Manufacture year: 2020 Controller manufacturer: unknown (feature xc8 unsupported) Controller version: unknown (feature xc8 unsupported) Firmware version: 3.4 The EDID model name is generic \"LG UltraFine\". This 5K monitor appears to have been built with only Macs in mind. It has no buttons, and no on screen display (OSD). Despite an extensive list of features in the capabilities string, getvcp for most returns with the unsupported feature bit set in the response packet. The only features in the capabilities string that can be read using getvcp are: 0x10 (brightness), xFD (manufacturer reserved), xFF (manufacturer reserved). In particular, getvcp of feature xDF (VCP version) fails. Per the MCCS specification, this feature must be supported as of MCCS 2.0. The following features unknown to MCCS are not listed in the capabilities string, but return a value for getvcp : xD1, xD3, xD5, xDD This monitor also supports USB access to the Virtual Display Panel, but the only feature supported through this interface is 0x10 (brightness).

(See issue LG 29UM69G fails switching input ) on github. Github user mbastian resported: After more than four months of back and forth with German support I've got this: Our Korean software development takes note of reports of this kind, but this does not lead to customer feedback. Wwe do not see any need for further action here. At first they where denying that DDC was even supported, when I've pointed them to the manual and spec sheet then they insisted that it only applied to the OSD. Finally they escalated it. I've explained in detail what my problem is, asked if there is a firmware update or an undocumented ddc feature.... and all I got is a not very nice \"Don't bother us again!\" LG 27BN88U 27UL850 27GN950-B 29UM69G 34Wk500-P 34WN80C-B 34UM88P 38WN95C Users of all these recent LG displays report similar problems with VCP feature X60 (Input Source). getvcp 60 always returns x00, which is not a valid value. setvcp 60 flashes the screen, sometimes opens the OSD, never sets the value LG 27UD88 29UMS7P Users report this monitors do support featrue x60 LG HDR 4K No model name string in EDID. The binary model number is set (x7702 = 30471) No ASCII serial number in EDID. Binary serial number is present VCP version: 2.1 Controller manufacturer: MStar (sl=x05) Controller Model: mh=x0, ml=xff, sh=x00 Firmware version: 3.4 Manufacture year: 2019 Properly sets the Unsupport VCP Code bit in a GETVCP response. LG Ultrawide VCP version: 2.1 Controller manufacturer and model: STK Firmware version: 0.1 Manufacture year: 2014 Feature codes are not separated by blanks in the vcp() section of the capabilities string. No serial number in the EDID. When responding to a Get VCP Feature request, the monitor never sets sets the Result Code field of the VCP Feature Reply to Unsupported VCP Code. Instead, it always reports No Error. For unsupported VCP codes, all bytes in the response (MH, ML, SH, SL) are set to x00. Mitsubishi RDT232WLM VCP Version: 2.1 Controller manufacturer and model: unreported (VCP feature code C8 unsupported) Firmware version: unreported (VCP feature code C9 unsupported) Manufacture year: 2010 DDC/CI communication works for DVI connector. Does not work on HDMI connector. DDC/CI communication requires signficant number of retries, and occasionaly fails because of the maximum number of retries is exceeded. Features x0B and X0C are not listed in the capabilities string. The monitor replies to getvcp requests for these features. The response to feature X0B (color temperature increment) is 50 degrees Kelvin, which is reasonable. The response to feature X0C (number of color temperature increments) is 0, resulting in a temperature of 3000 degrees Kelvin, which is nonsensical. Responds to getvcp for feature xA8, which is not defined in the MCCS specification. Monoprice Dark Matter 40776 VCP Version: 2.1 Controller manufacturer: Mstar Controller model: mh=x00, ml=xff, sh=x56 Firmware version: 0.0 Manufacture year: 2020 This monitor has 2 HDMI inputs and 2 DisplayPort inputs. The capabilities string reports that VCP feature x60 takes the values x11, x12, x0f, and x10, which per the MCCS spec are HDMI-1, HDMI-2, DisplayPort-1 and DisplayPort-2 respectively. However the actual values, which are reported by getvcp and settable by setvcp are: x05 - HDMI-1 x06 - HDMI-2 x07 - DisplayPort-1 x08 - DisplayPort-2 A new input source can only be set when ddcutil setvcp 60 is issued from the current input source. It is also the case that getvcp and other queries only work when issued on the current input source. The ASCII \"serial number\" in the EDID is blank, and the binary serial number is 0. Consequently, 2 monitors manufactured at the same time will have identical EDIDs, which will confuse software that depends on the EDID to uniquely identify a display. NEC LCD3090WQXi VCP Version 2.0 Controller manufacturer and model: unreported (VCP feature code C8 unsupported) Firmware version: unreported (VCP feature code C9 unsupported) Manufactur year: 2012 Color temperature increment: x0B 100 degress kelvin Color temperature request 35 -> 3000 + 35*100 = 6500 NEC P241W VCP Version 2.0 Controller manufacturer and model: unreported (VCP feature code C8 unsupported) Firmware version: unreported (VCP feature code C9 unsupported) The capabilities string has 2 additional sets of features, designated vcp_p02 and vcp_p10, in addition to the set specified in the vcp() field. It also reports the commands xC2, xC4, xC6 and xC8, which are not part of the DDC/CI specification. Likely these commands are feature request/response pairs for vcp_p02 and vcp_p10. Does not use the usual VCP codes (e.g. x16/Red Gain) for color control. Instead uses the 6 axis color control features x8c..xa0. Has an internal hardware LUT, but it is not accessed using the MCCS defined features for LUT mannipulation. Uses a proprietary USB for communication, which does not support adhere to the USB Monitor Control Class Specification . NEC PA241 VCP Version 2.0 Controller manufacturer and model: unreported (VCP feature code C8 unsupported) Firmware version: unreported (VCP feature code C9 unsupported) Implements both I2C and USB interfaces. Makes heavy use of manufacturer specific VCP feature codes. Also, ddcutil capabilities --verbose reports numerous manufacturer specific DDC commands The USB interface also makes heavy use of manufacturer specific usage codes. Monitor must be set to ??? to allow changes. VCP code x0c (Color Temperature Request) returns 0, which is nonsensical. Does not use the usual VCP codes (e.g. x16/Red Gain) for color control. Instead uses the 6 axis color control features x8c..xa0. Phillips 328P6VU VCP Version: 2.2 (capabilities string) VCP Version: 3.0 (feature xDF) Controller manufacturer: Mstar (sl=0x05), controller number: mh=0xff, ml=0x16, sh=0x00 Firmware version: 0.0 Manufacture year: 2019 The EDID contains a binary serial number, but does not contain an ASCII \"serial number\". VCP code 0x0b (Color temperature increment ): 100 degree(s) Kelvin When VCP code 0x14 (Select color preset) = User 1 (0x0b): VCP code 0x0c (Color temperature request ): 3000 + 35 * (feature 0B color temp increment) degree(s) Kelvin -> 6500 degrees Kelvin This is sensible. Feature xDF (VCP Version) incorrectly reports that the VCP version is 3.0. Problems with feature x60 (Input Source): - In MCCS version 3.0, feature x60 (Input Source) is of type Table, not Non-Continuous. Because of this getvcp incorrectly reads the feature value, and setvcp fails because it expects a value of type Table as input. - Feature value x00, which is not listed in any MCCS specification, represents the USB-C connector. Feature xc0 (Display Usage Time) reports mh=ml=0xff, sh=sl=x00, which is nonsense.

In both cases they were using the amdgpu video driver This was true no matter which DisplayPort version was chosen in the OSD. As of 12/2020, this is not fixed by the most recent monitor firmware update. User razamatan reports that he was told in Samsung's chat support that DDC/CI is not implemented on DisplayPort. The capabilites string reports an unrecognized command code, x4e Feature x14 (Color Perset), x06 (Color Temperature Increament) and x06 (Color temperature requrest) appear consistent. In one report: VCP code 0x14 (Select color preset ): 7500 K (sl=0x06) Color temperature increment (x0b) = 50 degrees Kelvin Color temperature request (x0c) = 90 Requested color temperature = (3000 deg Kelvin) + 90 * (50 degrees Kelvin) = 7500 degrees Kelvin The monitor has two DisplayPort inputs and one HDMI input. However, the capabilities string reports valid values as being as x01 - VGA and X03 - DVI-1. The following features are not declared in the capabiliteis string but were found by scanning: Feature x52 - Active control Feature xb2 - Flat panel sub-pixel layout Feature xf4 - Manufacturer Specific Feature xfe - Manufacturer Specific Samsung U32H750 VCP version reported by capabilities string: 2.1, VCP version reported by feature xdf: 2.0 Controller manufacturer and model: Mstar, model id: mh=x00, ml=0x10, sh=0x00 Firmware version: 0.1 This monitor is a MCCS disaster area. The capabilities string returned by the monitor is malformed. As a result, ddcutil cannot parse the \"cmds\" field. Features x0B and X0C are unsupported. Cannot calculate color temperature. No matter what the color mode (x14 Preset, xDC Display Mode) color settings (x16, x18, x1a) cannot be changed. Brightness (x10) and contrast can be changed only in some modes. Values in the capabilities string correlate poorly with observed values. For example, according to the capaiblities string, feature x60 (Input source) has values x11, x12, and x0f, which the MCCS spec defines as HDMI-1, HDMI-2 and DisplayPort-1 respectively. However, the observed values are x05, x06, and x0f, which the MCCS spec defines as Composite video 1, Composite video 2, and Displayport respectively.

Monitor capabilities strings are cached to improve performance of the capabilities command. Partial workarounds for problems in DRM video drivers (e.g. i915, AMDGPU) when monitors are connected to a docking station. The monitor may not be detected (because no EDID is reported), or the monitor may appear as two different /dev/i2c devices. When probing /dev/i2c devices for monitors, ddcutil could put AMD Navi2 devices (e.g. RX6000 series) into an inconsistent state. This is because the driver exposes an I2C device for the SMU. Display detection is modified to avoid probing these devices. The interface exposed by shared library libddcutil is unchanged.

Prior announcements can be found here . 08 February 2021 ddcutil release 1.0.1 addresses the situation wherein a display connected through a docking station is not detected when the i915 video driver is used. (I2C support for docking station connected displays, and more generally displays using DisplayPort Multi Stream Transport. was recently implemented for i915 and amdgpu drivers in Kernel 5.10. Initial ddcutil code for this situation did not adequately work around problems in the driver implementation. 03 February 2021 ddcutil release 1.0.0 marks a milestone. It is time to regard ddcutil as having reached production status. There of course remain features to add, and the codebase warrants cleanup, but the feature set has been stable for some time. Bug reports are infrequent, and reflect unusual situations. There are two enhancements of general interest: User Defined Features , which have existed for some time, are now formally available. Option --mccs now applies to getvcp , setvcp , and dumpvcp as well as vcpinfo . The remaining changes in this release, while extensive, are likely of little interest to most users. The most notable changes are: ddcutil no longer by default checks for monitors exposing the Virtual Control Panel over USB. Such monitors have proven rare, and messages about lack of permission to read /dev/usb/hiddev devices can be be needless confusing. Command option --enable-usb will activate handling of USB connected monitors. The detect commands provides additional information about the monitors found. The capabilities command better handles malformed capabilities strings. getvcp has special handling for features x62 (audio volume), x87 (audio treble), x91 (audio bass), and x93 (audio balance). In MCCS 2.2 and 3.0, these otherwise continuous VCP features have special reserved values. Parsing setvcp command arguments was incorrect when multiple features are changed on a single setvcp command. The shared library API has minor, but not upwardly compatible, changes.

The missing changes have been pushed to the master branch. If you have already built release 0.9.9 from the github master branch, pull the changes and rebuild. 28 June 2020 ddcui release 0.1.2 is an emergency bug fix release. Combo boxes for simple Non-Continous features were empty instead of showing the currently selected value and list of allowed values. 24 June 2020 ddcutil release 0.9.9 contains two changes of general interest: A new command line option, --less-sleep eliminates many of the delays between the time that ddcutil receives a DDC response from a display and sends the next request, improving performance. Support for AMD's old proprietary fglrx driver has been dropped. The libddcutil shared libray has non-upwardly compatible changes. For details, see Shared Library Changes for Release 0.9.9 . ddcui release 0.1.1 adds additional features and has numerous changes in the \"fit and finish\" category. In particular: Command line options for starting ddcui , corresponding to settings in the Option dialogs, and (if multiple monitors) the initlal monitor selected. The Feature Selection Dialog , along with command line option --custom-feature-set , enable the user to specify the VCP features to be shown.

Lastly, this website has been extensively revised to reflect the current state of ddcutil and ddcui . Note: Prebuilt packages are now available for ddcutil 0.9.9. 06 December 2019 ddcutil release 0.9.8 contains two changes of general interest: - A new command line option, --sleep-multiplier , adjusts the time ddcutil pauses between sending a request to the monitor and reading from the monitor. - A fix for the bug that certain mice would lock up during display detection. The libddcutil shared library API has some minor extensions. For details, see Library Changes for Release 0.9.8 . Graphical user interface ddcui has reached beta status.

The API has also been revised to support user supplied feature definitions (see API Changes in Release 0.9.3 ). For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prior announcements can be found here . ddcui release 0.0.3 reflects changes to the ddcutil API. 15 September 2018 ddcui is a Qt-based graphical user interface for ddcutil . An initial alpha release is now available on github . ddcui must currently be built from source - there are no pre-built (e.g. dpkg or rpm) packages. For addtional information and rudimentary build instructions, see files README.md and BUILDING.md . 01 September 2018 Release 0.9.2 contains minor enhancements and bug fixes. For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes .

For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prior announcements can be found here . 13 May 2018 Release 0.9.0 contains minor enhancements and a few very minor bug fixes. However. the C API is extensively revised (see API Changes in Release 0.9.0 ). Two enhancements will be of interest to general users: - The setvcp command now allows new values for Continuous type features to be specified as relative values, e.g. the following commands increase or decrease the value of the brightness feature by 5. $ ddcutil setvcp 10 + 5 $ ddcutil setvcp 10 - 5 Note that parsing requires that \"+\" and \"-\" be surrounded by spaces. Table type features are by default not included in most feature groups specified on getvcp , e.g. getvcp known . Features of type Table are rare. The DDC/CI spec does not provide a clean way for getvcp to determine that a table feature does not exist. As a result, getvcp typically has to exceed its retry count before giving up. (Exclusion of table features does not occur if a feature is explicitly specified by its hex code, or for feature group TABLE .) The --no-table (formerly --notable ) and -show-table options explicitly control this behavior. For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prior announcements can be found here . 20 January 2018 Release 0.8.6 contains a few minor externally visible enhancements and bug fixes, along with non-upwardly compatible changes to the C API. Most current users will see no need to upgrade. For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prior announcements can be found here . ddcutil is now in the repositories for the upcoming Ubuntu 18.04 release and the openSUSE Tumbleweed rolling release. 16 November 2017 Release 0.8.5 contains a large number of minor enhancements and bug fixes. Users of ddcutil on 32 bit platforms and those on the Raspberry Pi should upgrade. For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prior announcements can be found here . 15 October 2017 Package ddcutil has been sponsored into Debian and is now included in Debian Testing . It is on track to be part of the next Debian release, which means it should eventually appear in downstream distributions such as Ubuntu. Note that only package ddcutil , containing the command line version of ddcutil , is currently in the Debian repositories.

For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prior annoucnements can be found here . 01 May 2017 Release 0.8.0 contains new features intended to address issues with particular monitors and user environments, and to improve performance The most significant changes visible to users are: If there are multiple monitors and option --async is specified, initial monitor checks are performed in separate threads. Users with multiple monitors should see significantly better startup time. If a display is specified by its I2C bus number (option --bus ) and option --nodetect is specified, global display detection is skipped, improving performance. By default, setvcp and loadvcp now read the VCP value after it has been set, to confirm that the monitor has made the change requested. Command getvcp --terse now reports VCP settings in a form that is easily machine readable. The C API has been extensively revised. Many names have changed for consistency and clarity.

OBS 29 April 2017 At some time in the recent past, the files for release 0.7.3 in the OpenSUSE Build Service were corrupted with files from the test system. Symptoms of this corruption include Prefixing a VCP feature code number with \"0x\" causes a segfault, e.g. \"ddcutil setvcp 0x10 50\" Command line option \"--verify\" is recognized As of this morning, the production ddcutil project on OBS was restored to release 0.7.3. 0.7.3 05 March 2017 Release 0.7.3 is a maintenance release. There is no need to install it unless you are experiencing problems. This release introduces the following features: Command ddcutil detect --verbose shows additional information. Command ddcutil environment --verbose implements additional diagnostic tests. configure option --enable-drm controls whether DRM is used to enhance the diagnostics of command ddcutil environment --verbose . If enable-drm=yes , package libdrm-dev or libdrm-devel (depending on Linux distribution) must be installed to build ddcutil . Setting --enable-drm=no affects only diagnostic output, not normal execution. For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prior annoucnements can be found here . 0.7.2 01 February 2017 Maintenance release. Fixes a critical bug in release 0.7.1 where insufficient privileges on a /dev/i2c-n device causes program termination. ddcutil interrogate always executes with --set-slave-address in effect Minor improvements to ddcutil environment and ddcutil interrogate output Minor improvements to ddcutil detect --verbose Add explanations for additional errno values For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prior annoucnements can be found here . 0.7.1 27 January 2017 Release 0.7.1 is a maintenance release. There is no need to install it unless you are experiencing problems. This release introduces the following features: Command option --force-slave-address causes ddcutil to attempt to take control of slave addresses on the I2C bus even if they are in use by another driver. This may aid in certain situations where monitors on an I2C bus are not properly detected. See Instrumentation and Tuning ) For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prior annoucnements can be found here . 0.7.0 03 January 2017 Release 0.7 introduces the following features: C API, exposed by shared library libddcutil . See API . A new command line option --mfg , allows for the 3 character manufaturer id found in the EDID to used as part of monitor selection. The monitor feature and capabilities portion of interrogate is also exposed by the new probe command which explores the capabilities string and features found on a single monitor. For details, see Release Notes . Prior annoucnements can be found here . openSUSE Build Service packaging of release 0.7.0 is complete. Owing to Launchpad constraints, the PPA will not be correct until ddcutil 's release is incremented, i.e. until release 0.7.1 0.6.1 21 November 2016 The most recent release of ddcutil is 0.6.1. This is a maintenance release and need not be installed unless you are experiencing problems. For details, see Release Notes . 0.6.0 01 October 2016 As of release 0.6, the name of this program changed from ddctool to ddcutil to avoid confusion with a commerical datacenter program also named ddctool.

If you have already built release 0.9.9 from the github master branch, pull the changes and rebuild. 28 June 2020 ddcui release 0.1.2 is an emergency bug fix release. Combo boxes for simple Non-Continous features were empty instead of showing the currently selected value and list of allowed values. 24 June 2020 ddcutil release 0.9.9 contains two changes of general interest: A new command line option, --less-sleep eliminates many of the delays between the time that ddcutil receives a DDC response from a display and sends the next request, improving performance. Support for AMD's old proprietary fglrx driver has been dropped. The libddcutil shared libray has non-upwardly compatible changes. For details, see Shared Library Changes for Release 0.9.9 . ddcui release 0.1.1 adds additional features and has numerous changes in the \"fit and finish\" category. In particular: Command line options for starting ddcui , corresponding to settings in the Option dialogs, and (if multiple monitors) the initlal monitor selected. The Feature Selection Dialog , along with command line option --custom-feature-set , enable the user to specify the VCP features to be shown. Better handling of error conditions Better Help text ddcui release 0.1.1 requires ddcutil 0.9.9. For general information about the graphical user interface, see ddcui . For a complete list of ddcutil changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . For ddcui changes and bug fixes, see ddcui Release Notes . Prior announcements can be found here . Lastly, this website has been extensively revised to reflect the current state of ddcutil and ddcui . Note: Prebuilt packages are now available for ddcutil 0.9.9. 06 December 2019 ddcutil release 0.9.8 contains two changes of general interest: - A new command line option, --sleep-multiplier , adjusts the time ddcutil pauses between sending a request to the monitor and reading from the monitor. - A fix for the bug that certain mice would lock up during display detection. The libddcutil shared library API has some minor extensions. For details, see Library Changes for Release 0.9.8 . Graphical user interface ddcui has reached beta status. Release 0.1.0 contains numermous improvements in the handling of particular VCP feature codes and the user interface generally. Prebuilt packages now exist for many platforms. See ddcui Overview . For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prior announcements can be found here . 08 October 2019 ddcui alpha release 0.0.6 is now available on github . It requires the version of libddcutil provided by ddcutil release 0.9.7. 04 September 2019 ddcutil release 0.9.7 fixes the cause of a segfault during display detection if a monitor appearing to support the USB Monitor Control Class Specification , i.e. one that uses USB to communicate monitor settings, is connected to the system. If also contains some minor code cleanup. For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prior announcements can be found here . 25 August 2019 ddcutil release 0.9.6 contains minor enhancements, bug fixes, and API changes. SONAME versioning is now enabled for libddcutil .

Prior announcements can be found here . ddcui release 0.0.4 reflects changes to the ddcutil API. 25 December 2018 ddcutil release 0.9.4 fixes a bug that caused the capabilities command to fail, and addresses the failure to build from source for the x32 ABI . For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prior announcements can be found here . 26 November 2018 ddcutil release 0.9.3 reworks display detection to avoid problems encountered with certain recent displays and laptops. There have been extensive internal changes to allow for future support of user supplied definitions for manufacturer-specific features. The API has also been revised to support user supplied feature definitions (see API Changes in Release 0.9.3 ). For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prior announcements can be found here . ddcui release 0.0.3 reflects changes to the ddcutil API. 15 September 2018 ddcui is a Qt-based graphical user interface for ddcutil . An initial alpha release is now available on github . ddcui must currently be built from source - there are no pre-built (e.g. dpkg or rpm) packages. For addtional information and rudimentary build instructions, see files README.md and BUILDING.md . 01 September 2018 Release 0.9.2 contains minor enhancements and bug fixes. For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prior announcements can be found here . 27 May 2018 Release 0.9.1 fixes the cause of a failure that may occur on command environment --verbose when examining an extremely large log file. For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prior announcements can be found here . 13 May 2018 Release 0.9.0 contains minor enhancements and a few very minor bug fixes. However. the C API is extensively revised (see API Changes in Release 0.9.0 ). Two enhancements will be of interest to general users: - The setvcp command now allows new values for Continuous type features to be specified as relative values, e.g. the following commands increase or decrease the value of the brightness feature by 5. $ ddcutil setvcp 10 + 5 $ ddcutil setvcp 10 - 5 Note that parsing requires that \"+\" and \"-\" be surrounded by spaces. Table type features are by default not included in most feature groups specified on getvcp , e.g. getvcp known . Features of type Table are rare. The DDC/CI spec does not provide a clean way for getvcp to determine that a table feature does not exist. As a result, getvcp typically has to exceed its retry count before giving up. (Exclusion of table features does not occur if a feature is explicitly specified by its hex code, or for feature group TABLE .) The --no-table (formerly --notable ) and -show-table options explicitly control this behavior. For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prior announcements can be found here . 20 January 2018 Release 0.8.6 contains a few minor externally visible enhancements and bug fixes, along with non-upwardly compatible changes to the C API. Most current users will see no need to upgrade. For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prior announcements can be found here . ddcutil is now in the repositories for the upcoming Ubuntu 18.04 release and the openSUSE Tumbleweed rolling release. 16 November 2017 Release 0.8.5 contains a large number of minor enhancements and bug fixes. Users of ddcutil on 32 bit platforms and those on the Raspberry Pi should upgrade. For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prior announcements can be found here . 15 October 2017 Package ddcutil has been sponsored into Debian and is now included in Debian Testing . It is on track to be part of the next Debian release, which means it should eventually appear in downstream distributions such as Ubuntu. Note that only package ddcutil , containing the command line version of ddcutil , is currently in the Debian repositories. The shared library packages, including the C and Python APIs, are not yet part of Debian. 22 July 2017 Release 0.8.4 primarily contains packaging changes to meet Fedora distribution standards. For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prior annoucnements can be found here . 17 May 2017 Release 0.8.2 contains minor enhancements, primarily to diagnostics in the environment and interrogate commands. For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prior annoucnements can be found here . 05 May 2017 Release 0.8.1 is a bugfix release that addresses a segfault that can occur when scanning for USB connected monitors. For a complete list of changes and bug fixes, see Release Notes . Prior annoucnements can be found here . 01 May 2017 Release 0.8.0 contains new features intended to address issues with particular monitors and user environments, and to improve performance The most significant changes visible to users are: If there are multiple monitors and option --async is specified, initial monitor checks are performed in separate threads. Users with multiple monitors should see significantly better startup time. If a display is specified by its I2C bus number (option --bus ) and option --nodetect is specified, global display detection is skipped, improving performance. By default, setvcp and loadvcp now read the VCP value after it has been set, to confirm that the monitor has made the change requested. Command getvcp --terse now reports VCP settings in a form that is easily machine readable. The C API has been extensively revised. Many names have changed for consistency and clarity.

It has been tested with the following distributions: Raspbian (Release 2017-09-07) Ubuntu 16.04 Fedora 26 openSUSE Tumbleweed with kernel 4.11.13 At least on The Raspberry Pi 2 or 3, the I2C bus for the HDMI connection is /dev/i2c-2. To enable it, the following line is required in the config.txt file: dtparam=i2c2_iknowwhatimdoing Alternatively, the experimental OpenGL vc4-kms-v3d driver enables /dev/i2c-2 automatically. In that case, the above i2c2_iknowwhatimdoing setting is not needed, though this may possibly change: dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d Also, ensure that i2c_dev is listed in /etc/modules, /etc/modules.conf, or a file in /etc/modules-load.d, as appropriate for your system. Prebuilt ddcutil packages for the Raspberry Pi are available for many distributions. See Repology for pointers. If there is no prebuilt version for your environment, or the prebuilt version is out of date, ddcutil can be built from source. Background Enabling /dev/i2c-2 requires the peculiar dtpararm statement described above, instead of the more expected: # Won't work! dtparam=i2c2 The parameter name was chosen as a caution. From the commit that added the option: The third I2C bus (I2C2) is normally reserved for HDMI use. Careless use of this bus can break an attached display - use with caution. It is recommended to disable accesses by VideoCore by setting hdmi_ignore_edid=1 or hdmi_edid_file=1 in config.txt. The interface is disabled by default - enable using the i2c2_iknowwhatimdoing DT parameter. The issue appears to be that application access to /dev/i2c-2 from the CPU is independent of, and so can conflict with, video driver access via the GPU (at least with the default driver). From an online comment : Yes, but the GPU considers itself to be the sole user of the BSC2 peripheral. Poking the i2c from the ARM CPU (via linux driver) will likely work, but beware if the GPU tries to access the same peripheral then bad things will happen. . As long as you stay away from hotplugging HDMI, or tvservice commands (or anything likely to use tvservice) then the GPU is unlikely cause any traffic on BSC2. As a practical matter, this does not appear to be an issue. Concerns have also been expressed about 3.3v vs 5v voltage incompatibility on the I2C bus, since the HDMI spec is 5v.

It requires the current version of libddcutil, libddcutil.so.4.1.0, which is built from source package ddcutil 1.1.1 As a distribution installation package, this is normally available as libddcutil4.rpm, libddcutil4.deb, etc. Configuration file ddcui uses the configuration file ddcutilrc in two different ways. - Sections [ddcui] and [global] specify options passed to ddcui. They are prepended to the string entered by the user that is passed to the ddcui command processor. - Sections [libddcutil] and [global] specify options passed to libddcutil . This is now the preferred method for passing options to the shared library. For details on the configuration file, see section Config File in the general ddcutil documentation Previously, several ddcui options were created simply to pass a value through to libddcutil . Instead of specifying these options on the ddcui command line, include them in the [libddcutil] section of the configuration file. The use of these ddcui options is deprecated. Some are removed in this version and some or all will be removed in a future release. Command line options removed in ddcui 0.2.0. Use the configuration file instead. Removed Option Purpose --sleep-multiplier Adjust sleep duration while waiting for a DDC response --sleep-less, -less-sleep Do not perform sleep in certain circumstances --dsa, --dynamic-sleep-adjustment &mbsp;Perform dynamic sleep adjustment --no-sleep-less Always peform sleep --udf Enable user defined features --noudf Disable user defined features --nousb Disable support for MCCS communication over USB --maxtries &nsbp;Adjust the number of retries for DDC operationas Options subject to future removal: Option Purpose --ddc Report DDC data errors --stats ?? Report statistics to the terminal at program termination --excp Report internal exceptionss to terminal --trace Specify a libddcutil trace group --trcfunc Specify a libddcutil function to be traced --trcfile Specify a libddcutil file to be traced Note that the following options are both passed to libddcutil and also recognized by the ddcui client. They are not deprecated. Option Purpose --ts, -=timestamp Prefix trace messages with timestamp --tid, --threadid Prefix trace messages with thread id Desktop Integation Install ddcui.desktop in /usr/share/applications Install ddcui.appdata.xml in /usr/share/metainfo Install icons in /usr/share/icons/hicolor, /usr/share/pixmaps Actions -> Redetect Displays This new action causes displays to be redetected. It can be used if displays are connected or disconnected. Semi-Continuous Values As of MCCS specification 3.0 and 2.2, several features have both a set of reserved values and with a continuous range. I've dubbed them \"semi-continuous\". A special widget now exists to represent these features. The widget has both a combo box for the reserved values and a slider/spinbox combination for the continuous range. The features affected are: Feature Comment Feature x62 (Audio Volume) MCCS 2.2 and 3.0 only Feature x87 (Audio Treble) MCCS 2.2 and 3.0 only X91 (Audio Bass) MCCS 2.2 and 3.0 only x93 (Audio Balance) MCCS 2.2 and 3.0 only ### Online Help Online help is extensively changed All help buttons now provide relevant help The main help screen (accessed from Help->Contents) now links to other help screens. Fomatting of help screens is more consistent Where appropriate, it is possible to navigate backward and forward among screens. Dialog boxes and help screens are more consistent in style. Development related command line options are documnented only buy options --help-development and --help-all Options Menu Rename Options menu entry User Interface Options -> User Interface for cosnsitency Rename dialog Other Options to NC Feature Value NC Feature Handling Two mechanisms have been implemented to address the problem of a NC feature value returned by the monitor that is not defined in the MCCS spec or the capabilities string. Sometimes the value is undefined for the monitor's MCCS version, but is defined in a later version. If dialog box option NC Feature Values ->Use Latest NC Values is checked, ddcui will use the value list for the most recent MCCS version that defines the feature, invariably 2.2. Option --use-latest-nc-values can be specified on the command line. Note that if the source of NC values is either Both or MCCS , this option causes the values and names to be taken from the latest MCCS release. If the source of values is Capabilities , the names for any values specified in the capabilities string are taken from the latest MCCS release. If the monitor returns an unrecognized value, we want to still show that value in the drop down menu after a different value is selected. This change remembers unrecognized values that have been seen. This memorization does not persist across ddcui calls. Even with these enhancements, unrecognized NC feature values are probably better handled using a user supplied feature definition. See User Defined Features Building ddcui Building using qmake is no longer supported. File ddcui.pro has been removed from git. Use cmake. File .gitignore has been pruned of entries that are not common to all git ddcui repos. Locally-specific files to be ignored should be listed in file .git/info/exclude, which is not under git control. Miscellaneous The monitor icon previously used by ddcui was replaced by one taken from the Oxygen theme, avoiding any question as to its provenance under an open source license. Option --stats reports execution statistics to the terminal when ddcui terminates normally.

Option -settings Until now, details of the current configuration and option settings have been shown at the start of any command when --verbose is in effect. This information has become increasing large and distracting. Instead, this information is now reported only when option --settings is specified. Tracing Option --syslog sends trace and debug messages to the system log in addition to the trace location. Option --wall-timestamp-- or --wts preface trace and debug messages with the current wall time. Fixes Build would fail when configure option ---enable x11=no was specified. API functions ddca_open_display() and ddca_open_display2() now always return DDCRC_ALREADY_OPEN if the display is already open in the current thread. Previously an assert failure would occur under certain circumstances. Numerous memory leaks in libddcutil have been plugged. 1.2.0 05 October 2021 Most visible changes in release 1.2.0 affect only shared library libddcutil . Users of the command line program ddcutil do not need to update. General Changes Option --enable-capabilities-cache is now the default. Command detect --verbose now reports the raw EDID. Major events are written to the system log. These include starting, stopping, and severe internal errors. Fix for github issue #178: Error detecting i2c-dev kernel module . The checks now use library libkmod (which is the basis for commands modinfo, lsmod, etc.). environment command If programs get-edid and parse-edid are installed, command ddcutil environment --verbose uses them for an addiional EDID check Extend sysfs diagnostics in ddcutil environment --verbose to better analyze problems in DisplayPort Multi-Stream Transport, in which a display appears as 2 different /dev/i2c devices. ddcutil environment --verbose now includes all the information of ddcutil detect --verbose . There is no need to submit the latter along with the former in issue reports. libddcutil trace file libddcutil can redirect all output that it would normally be sent to the terminal to a trace file instead. The file is specified using option --libddcutil-trace-file . This option can be only be specified in the [libddcutil] section of the ddcutil configuration file, ddcutilrc . The file name given can be either absolute or relative. If relative, the directory is resolved as per the definition of XDG_STATE_HOME in the XDG specification. Typically this is $HOME/.local/state/ddcutil. This allows for tracing in situations where there is no terminal to which to write, e.g. PowerDevil in KDE Plasma. API changes New Function Comments ddca_add_trace_groups Add to the set of traced groups ddca_get_extended_version_string Version string with optional suffix, e.g. \"1.1.2-rc2\" ddca_redetect_displays Redetect displays ddca_get_display_refs Returns a null-terminated list of valid DDCA_Display_Refs ddca_get_display_info Returns DDCA_Display_Info for a DDCA_Display_Ref Notes: The existing API function ddca_set_trace_groups() replaces the existing set of trace groups, while ***ddca_add_trace_groups() adds to the current set. Calling ddca_get_display_refs() followed by ddcau_get_display_info() calls for each display is preferred over ddca_get_display_info_list2()***. Experience has shown that it leads to cleaner client code. New Macro Comments DDCUTIL_VSUFFIX version suffix (may be \"\") Miscellaneous libddcutil changes The shared library name is now libddcutil.so.4.1.0 Additional checks are performed on DDCA_Display_Ref and DDCA_Display_Handle() function arguments. assert{} statements are used in libddcutil for situations that should be logically impossible. To aid in remote problem diagnosis, many of these statements have been replaced by macro TRACE_ASSERT(), which additionally writes a messsage to both the libddcutil trace log and the system log. 1.1.0 05 April 2021 Docking station connected displays At long last, Linux kernel release 5.10 implemented DDC communication over DisplayPort Multi-Stream Transport. Most commonly, this is seen with displays connected to docking stations. For several years now, all docking station connected displays, even those using HDMI or DVI connections, internally rely on a DisplayPort MST connection between the computer and the docking station. The kernel changes were made in the Direct Rendering Mode (DRM) subsytem. The Intel i915 and AMD amdgpu drivers, which are implemented as part of DRM, have been tested and (mostly) work. Other drivers part of the kernel DRM component, e.g. nouveau, should also work but have not been tested. Nvidia's proprietary driver uses it own proprietary DRM implementation and still does not support DDC communication over MST. Unfortunately there are problems with the DRM code, which ddcutil can only sometimes work around. Sometimes the display's EDID cannot be read on I2C slave address x50. As a result, ddcutil does not report the existence of a display connected to the /dev/i2c device. ddcutil attempts to work around this by trying to read the EDID multiple times with both 128 and 256 block sizes. Depending on the monitor, usually one or the other will work, but sometimes neither do. Option --edid-read-size , which was introduced in release 1.0.1, can force the block size to 128 or 256. This problem can be unrecoverable when the computer suspends and resumes, requiring reboot. On the other hand, the same monitor may appear as two different /dev/i2c devices, only one of which supports DDC. Curiously EDID read failures are associated with the /dev/i2c device that supports DDC. ddcutil attempts to detect which /dev/i2c device should be used for monitor communication, and the detect command reports the other as a \"Phantom Display\" instead of an \"Invalid Display\". (Thank you laur89 for the wonderfully apt term.) My sincere thanks to github users laur89 and boscard for their considerable help in diagnosing this situation and testing (partial) solutions. Configuration file ddcutilrc ddcutil 's command options have proliferated, often to address problems specific to a small number of users. To simplify their use, they can now be specified in a configuration file. For details, see Configuration File Persistent capabilities capabilities is the most expensive ddcutil command in elapsed time. It is also the most prone to failure on marginal I2C host/monitor connections, due the large number of I2C requests involved. On the other hand, the capabilities string is constant for a monitor model. ddcutil now caches capaiblities strings, significantly speeding up execution of the capabilities command. This feature is controlled by options --enable-capabilities-cache and --disable-capabilities-cache . The default is --enable-capabilities-cache . --disable-capabilities-cache may be needed as there are some edge cases not yet addressed The cache is located in file ddcutil/capabilities of the XDG cache directory. Typically this is $HOME/.cache/ddcutil/capabilities. This file can safely be erased if the stored capabilities string should become corrupted in some way. Miscellaneous Warn the user at ddcutil startup if module i2c-dev is neither loaded nor built into the kernel. This should help new users properly configure their systems. More detailed output on the detect command, particularly with option --verbose . environment --verbose has more extensive diagnostics, particulary of /sys Avoid corrupting the state of AMD Navi4 gpus, e.g. RX 6000 series, by not examining SMU I2C buses on the video adapter. Building ddcutil configure option --disable-usb now implies --disable-udev . This addresses a build failure reported by Amon Sha. 1.0.1 08 February 2021 This bug fix release addresses the situation wherein a display connected through a docking station was not detecteed when the i915 video driver is used. (I2C support for docking station connected displays, and more generally displays using DisplayPort Multi Stream Transport. was recently implemented for i915 and amdgpu drivers in Kernel 5.10. Initial ddcutil code for this situation did not adequately work around problems in the driver implementation, with the result that the EDID was not read in certain contexts. Option --edid-read-size Command line option --edid-read-size , introduced in release 1.0.0, is no longer needed. ddcutil not attempts both 128 and 256 byte reads to fetch the EDID. 1.0.0 03 February 2021 User Defined Features ddcutil , for some time now, has implementated user supplied feature definitions. This facility is now formally available. A feature definition file for a monitor model specifies feature definitions that add to or override those in the MCCS spec. It can also optionally force the MCCS version of the monitor. A user supplied feature definition can, for example, specify a monitor's actual values for a Non-Continuous feature such as x60 (Input Source), or define a feature in the manufacturer supplied range xE0..XFF. The facility is enabled by option --udf . The default is currently --noudf . See page User Defined Features for details. USB By default, ddcutil no longer checks for monitors that use USB to communicate with the monitor's Virtual Control Panel . Such monitors are rare, and the error messages that occur when permissions have not been granted on /dev/usb/hiddev devices can be confusuing. USB display detection can be enabled using command line option --enable-usb . The default is --disable-usb . Command detect If no displays are found, add a message suggesting ddcutil environment Always show the product code and binary serial number Additional /sys information for --verbose output Revised logic to better handle some marginal monitor/driver cases Command capabilities The capabilities command now issues detailed error messages for malformed capabilities strings, and attempts to continue if recovery from the parsing error can produce useful information. Fixed instances of assert failures when parsing a capabilities string with unmatched parentheses or the in which the model name is unparenthesized. In the \"Commands\" segment, the id values are referred to as \"operation codes\" for consistency with DDC/CI documentaion. Capitalization in command output is more consistent. Command getvcp If getvcp does not know how to format a value, it now includes the mh, ml, sh, and sl byte values in the \"UNABLE TO FORMAT OUTPUT\" message. Implement special handling for features x62 (audio volume) x87 (audio treble), x91 (audio bass) and x93 (audio balance). In MCCS 3.0 and 2.2, these features have special reserved values along with a range of continuous values. Fix the cause of an assert failure when showing the value of feature x93 (audio balance). Command setvcp The parsing of setvcp arguments has been rewritten to correctly allow for more than 1 relative values. A command such as \"setvcp 10 +15\" was was incorrectly being interpreted as indicating a relative feature value. The \"+\" or \"-\" in relative values must be surrounded by spaces. Command dumpvcp If no file name is specified on the command line, dumpvcp now writes its output to a newly created file in directory $HOME/.local/share/ddcutil. Documentation has been changed to conform to code behavior. Fixed the cause of the user name being null in the generated portion of the file name. An example of a generated file name is: DELL_P2411H-F8NDP11G119U-20201206-091307.vcp where: - DELL_P2411H is the model name reported by the EDID - F8NDP11G119U is the ASCII \"serial number\" in the EDID - 20201206-091307 is a timestamp of when the file was created Command watch Better handle fatal errors instead of continuing in an infinite loop Command environment If option --verbose is specified, the /sys file system is probed far more extensively. This change also applies to command interrogate , which incorporates environment --verbose . Option --no-x52-fifo Features x02 (new control value) and feature x52 (active control) are used together to report feature values changed using the On Screen Display (OSD). In MCCS 2.0 and 2.1, if feature x02 has the value x02 (changed controls exist) feature x52 is read once to get the id of a feature that has changed. The changed feature can be read in the usual way. Feature x02 is then read again to see if there are more features that have changed. In MCCS 3.0 and 2.2, feature X52 is supposed to be a FIFO of the ids of changed features. It is intended to be read until value x00 is returned, indicating no more features. It has been observed that at least for some v2.2 monitors (HP Z22i), feature x52 never returns x00, just always returns the same feature id. This option forces the watch command to treat all monitors as having the VCP 2.0/2.1 behavior. Option --mccs <vcp version> Option --mccs now applies to commands getvcp , setvcp , and dumpvcp in addition to vcpinfo . See documentation of the individual commands for details. Option --per-thread-stats Option ---per-thread-stats causes --stats output to include per thread statistics. By default, the --stats option does not display per thread statistics. These statistics are generally meaninful only in the shared library context, and their display is simply TMI TM . Option --enable-sleep-less Option --sleep-less , now also known as --enable-sleep-less is now the default. This eliminates some sleeps after reading DDC packets, and does not appear to affect stability. Option --disable-sleep-less restores the prior behavior. Option --edid-read-size <128|256> This option is a work-around for a problem seen with the i915 driver and docking stations. The EDID is read successfully every other time. Older EDIDs are 128 bytes in length, newer ones are 256 bytes. Strangely forcing ddcutil to read 128 bytes resolves this problem. Miscellaneous Changes and Bug Fixes Fix trace message corruption when both --thread-id ( --tid ) and --timestamp ( --ts ) are both specified. If any tracing is enabled, report the ddcutil starting and ending clock times. More functions can be individually traced using --trcfunc . Check during command parsing that functions specified by --trcfunc are in fact individually traceable. Option --nodetect is eliminated. It was reduncant since using the --bus option forces display detection to be skipped, and this is the only context in which option --nodetect was recognized. Fix the recording of the minimum and maxium maxtries values that occur in each thread. Correct --help output to indiate that \"0\" or \".\" in a --maxtries value string leaves the value of a try type unchanged. This was incorrectly documented as \".\" or \"\". For example, \"--maxtries \"., 15, 0\"\" changes only the write-read maxtries value. At startup, check that module i2c-dev is either loaded or built in. An unsupported feature is no longer regarded as a DDC data error (reported by option --ddc ). Reduce the number of error messages written to stderr instead of stdout . Bring the README.md file up to date. More definitively identify LVDS laptop displays. Building ddcutil Some configure options have been added, primarily in support of an as yet incomplete FreeBSD implementation. (Development is suspended until FreeBSD's video drivers expose the I2C bus.) Option Default Description --enable-asan no Build for execution with the Google Address Space Sanitizer. --enable-envcmds yes Controls whether commands environment and usbenvironment are included. --enable-udev yes Controls whether udev is used. --enable-targetbsd no Build for FreeBSD. Notes: - Option --disable-envcmds forces --disable-drm , and --disable-x11 - Option --enable-targetbsd forces --disable-envcmds , --disable-udev , and --disable-usb Option- -with-adl-headers has been removed. configure help messages for options that are not intended for public use are now marked \"(Developer only)\". Use of the .gitignore file has been simplified. It now identifies only files that should be ignored by any clone of the github ddcutil repository. Users should now list files specific to their copy of the repository in the file .git/info/exclude , which is not tracked. Shared Library The SONAME for libddcutil is now libddcutil.so.4. For details on changes, see Shared Library Changes for Release 1.0.0 . Acknowledgements Thank you to the many users who have not not only submitted problem reports but have helped remotely diagnose ddcutil issues. In particular: github users suuuehgi and laurisriple provided extensive help diagnosing problems with the i915 driver and docking stations. PJ Aitken has put considerable effor into reverse enginering Picture-by-Picture mode on a Phillips 499P9. github user parkerlreed helped diagnose deviations from the specification of feature x60 on an Acer ED320QR. And also a shout out to Andrey Rahmatullin who sponsors ddcutil on Debian and has help bring its packaging up to Debian standards. 0.9.9 13 June 2020 Execution Statistics Additional per-thread statistics are shown when --verbose is specified along with --stats . Statistics output has become voluminous. New group ELAPSED (alternatively TIME ) shows only the elapsed execution time. For example $ ddcutil detect --stats elapsed Statistics now seperately reports multi-part read and multi-part write tries. This reflects how statistics are implementated, allowing for Table features. As a practival matter, no monitor has ever been seen that implements features of type Table , so the multi-part write statistics will always be zero. Performance Related Command Options Option: --less-sleep , --sleep-less Eliminates many of the sleeps between the time that ddcutil receives a response packet from the display and then sends the next request packet. Depending on monitor, this can markedly improve performance, at the cost of more retries owing to increased DDC communication errors. Option --sleep-multipler still applies to the remaining sleeps. Less Useful Performace Related Command Optons The remaining new performance related options seemed like good ideas, but do not appear to significantly reduce execution time. They are included for user experimentation and feedback. They may be removed in future releases. Option: --lazy-sleep Causes some sleep events required by the DDC/CI protocol to occur in deferred mode. Instead of immediately sleeping after DDC IO events that require an interval before the next request is made of the display, the required sleep time is added to the current realtime value and saved in the associated display reference. Before the next DDC IO message to the display, the value in the display reference is checked, and if greater than the now current real time, a sleep for the remaining time occurs. Unfortunately, this option appears to have only a neglible effect on execution time. Execution statistics show an approximately 1 ms reduction in sleep time, e.g. 50 to 49 miliiseconds. This negligable effect reinforces the fact that most of ddcutil 's elapsed time is spent in DDC mandated delays and waiting for DDC IO to complete. ' Option: --dynamic-sleep-adjustment , (alternative name --dsa ) If retry is required, dynamically increases the delay time before subsequent retries, up to a maximum. Does not appear to have an appreciable effect on retry success, but it may be a useful alternative to option --sleep-multiplier . Other Options Option: --timeout-i2c-io Causes (most) I2C read and write calls to eventually time out if they do not return. This has been implemented as a POSSIBLE way to address occasional reports of ddcutil locking up, with subsequent ddcutiil calls blocking behind it. This may become the default in future releases. Support for fglrx removed ddcutil no longer supports AMD's old proprietary display driver fglrx . Command line option --adl is no longer recognized. configure option --with-adl has been removed. Miscellaneous Command ddcutil environment should have output the message \"Group i2c does not exist\" if group i2c was not found. The critical word \"not\" was missing. Thank you Micha\u00ebl Defferrard. The display identifier cross-reference table output by command ddcutil environment --verbose has been modifed to handle multiple displays with an identical EDID. Certain LG Ultrawide monitors contain neither an ASCII nor binary serial number in their EDID. Consequently, all monitors of the same model have the same EDID. Display detection now reads the EDID a byte at a time, similarly to command get-edid . This is occasionaly more reliable than the standard multi-byte read code. Thank you \"InconsolableCellist\" for pointing out this difference between ddcutil and get-edid . I2C slave address (DDC) is once again checked during display detection. This had been removed in release 0.9.3 because it caused lockups on Dell XPS 13 laptops. To address this situation, slave address x37 is not checked for laptop displays, which never support DDC. Command ddcutil detect --verbose reports the result of the x37 test. This is presently purely for informational purposes. Correctly handle multiple relative values in a single setvcp string, e.g. $ddcutil setvcp 10 + 5 12 - 3 This frankly not very useful corner case had not been taken into account when relative setvcp values were implemented. Well, now it is. ddcutil issues an error message instead of aborting if an utterly nonsensical --sleep-multiplier value greater than 100 is specified, e.g. $ ddcutil detect --sleep-multiplier 200 # WRONG Verification is always disabled if setting VCP feature xDF (Power Mode) to 5. This is a write-only value that turns off the display. Verification can never succeed. Correct the spelling of \"Finnish\" in the list of On Screen Display languages for feature xCC. Thank you Simon Alling. Tracing Trace group RETRY has been added. This subset of trace group DDCIO reports only retry activity. In a handful of unusual situations, trace messages are issued unconditionally, irrespective of the trace settings in effect. This is to highlight some rare situations, such as recovery from multiple DDC Null Messages. $ ddcutil getvcp 10 (ddc_wright_read_with_retry) ddc_write_read() succeeded after 3 Null Messages If you encounter such a message, please report the circumstances in which it occurred. Building ddcutil As noted above, ddcutil no longer supports AMD's old proprietary video driver fglrx . configure option --with-adl no longer exists. Reflecting changes to how the PCI and USB hardware ID tables are packaged, ddcutil now prioritizes pci.ids and usb.ids files in directory /usr/share/misc over those in /usr/share/hwdata. Packaging requires packages pci.ids, usb.ids, and usbutils, not hwdata. Corresponding changes have been made to configuration file configure.ac . Thank you Pino Toscano. Use of include file <sys/cdefs.h> has been eliminated. This include file does not exist on Alpine Linux. Shared Library The SONAME for libddcutil is now libddcutil.so.3. For details see Shared Library Changes for Release 0.9.9 . 0.9.8 30 November 2019 Command line option --sleep-multiplier The DDC/CI specification dictates that the host computer wait 40-200 ms (depending on operation) between sending a command to the monitor and reading the response. As a result, ddcutil spends approximately 90% of its elapsed time sleeping. Many monitors respond properly with much shorter waits. On the other hand, there are some monitors that require longer waits to avoid DDC/CI errors. Option --sleep-multiplier applies a floating point multiplication factor to the DDC/CI specified sleep times. For example, --sleep-multiplier .5 causes 40 ms waits to become 20 ms, and --sleep-multiplier 4 causes 40 ms waits to beome 160 ms. Note that ddcutil may automatically increase wait times when peforming retries. Option --sleep-multiplier applies to the inital wait time. Option --sleep-multiplier can significantly speed up ddcutil execution - some monitors have been seen to operate properly with a sleep-multiplier as low as .1, Undocumented option -y for adjusting wait times is removed. Command line options --thread-id and --timestamp If option --thread-id (alternatively --tid ) is specified, trace messages are prefixed with the thread id number, e.g. [ 27044](ddc_get_nontable_vcp_value ) dh=Display_Handle[i2c: fd=3, busno=5], Reading feature 0x00 if option --timestamp (alternatively --ts ) is specified, trace messages are prefixed with the number of seconds since the start of program execution, e.g. [ 1.827](ddc_get_vcp_value ) Starting. Reading feature 0x00, dh=Display_Handle[i2c: fd=3, busno=9], dh->fd=3 If both options are specified, then both thread id and timestamp are shown. Mouse corruption during display detection When examining USB devices to determine if they support the USB Monitor Control Class Specification , it was possible to hang USB connected mice. This change peforms a pre-check to ignore mice and keyboards. It affects: - Normal ddcutil commands, e.g. ddcutil detect - The usbenvironment command - Command chkusbmon , intended for use in UDEV rules. Display Detection messages When DDC/CI communication fails during display detection and a monitor is reported as an \"Invalid Display\", if the display appears to belong to a laptop, issue a message that laptop displays do not support DDC/CI. This should reduce the incidence of people needlessly trying to diagnose a DDC/CI communication failure. Command ddcutil detect now shows a blank instead of \"unspecified\" to indicate that an EDID is not found. Miscellaneous Improve the output for feature x14 (Color Preset) to take into account the MH byte, which is defined in MCCS 3.0 and 2.2. ( Unfortunately, observed behavior on at least one MCCS 2.2 monitor, an HP Z22i, does not match the spec.) API Changes See Shared Library Changes for Release 0.9.8 for details. 0.9.7 04 September 2019 Fixes the cause of a segfault during display detection if a monitor appearing to support the USB Monitor Control Class Specification , i.e. one that uses USB to communicate monitor settings, is connected to the system. Properly handle failure when querying a feature value using USB. Plug a minor memory leak during display detection when checking if a display is an eDP device, i.e. a laptop monitor. Thank you Federico. Some debug messages still occurring in production code were disabled. Minor code cleanup to avoid warnings in Coverity static analysis. 0.9.6 25 August 2019 Command line option --nousb . This option disables the USB portion of display detection during ddcutil startup. There has been a user report that ddcutil sometimes freezes the trackpoint in a Lenovo keyboard with trackpoint (specifically Lenovo SK-8855) during display detection. The option provides a work around. Note that USB display detection is rarely required, as most monitors do not use USB to communicate settings. However, USB display detection is much, much faster than normal I2C display detection, so disabling it has a negligable effect on ddcutil execution time API Changes See API Changes in Release 0.9.6 for details. 0.9.5 24 February 2019 Feature x72 (Gamma) Added support for Virtual Control Panel feature x72 (Gamma). This is an unusual complex non-continuous feature in that its value can be changed by the user, and the parenthesized \"values\" in the capabilities string require special interpretation. The following commands have been modified: - ddcutil getvcp 72 : Interpret the output - ddcutil capabilities : Interpret the parenthesized \"values\" substring - ddcutil setvcp : See below. Command setvcp Can now take 2 byte values an an argument. Values can be specified as hexadecimal (SH byte then SL) or as decimal (0..655335). Example: ddcutil setvcp 72 x7800 Specifies SH=x78 (native gamma=2.2), SL=x00 (absolute adjustment, ideal tolerance) Thanks to YamashitaRen for pointing out the need to allow for 2 byte values and helping test the support for feature x72. Configuration and Diagnostics Contrary to existing documentation, kernel module i2c_dev is in fact required when using the proprietary Nvidia driver. Reported by Igor Ovsyanka. Kernel module documentation has been corrected, and command ddcutil environment has been updated. Bug Fixes Fix the cause of an assert failure when displaying the value of feature x8F (Audio Treble) or x91 (Audio Bass). Reported by Igor Ovsyanka. Monitor Quirks Instead of setting the \"unsupported feature\" bit in the getvcp reply packet for an unsupported feature, the Dell AW3418DW causes I2C failure with Linux errno EIO . ddcutil now interprets the EIO response as indicating an unsupported feature instead of reporting an error. This special handling currently applies only to the Dell AW3418DW. Miscellaneous Update file README.md and make it more usable as the github overview file. API Changes See API Changes in Release 0.9.5 for details. 0.9.4 25 December 2018 Fix the cause of failure to build from source for the x32 ABI . The file output by the dumpvcp command no longer contains a TIMESTAMP_MILLIS field, the number of seconds since start of the machine epoch, typically January 1, 1970. This field, and its companion TIMESTAMP_TEXT , are ignored on input, so this change can only affect an external program that relies on the TIMESTAMP_MILLIS field, say for sorting. Thank you Jan Palus, who encountered the problem when building ddcutil for the PLD Linux distribution. Fix an execution failure that resulted from attempting to open an already opened display. This occured on the capabilities command when the vcp field in the string returned by the monitor was damaaged or missing, causing ddcutil to attempt to read the VCP version from feature 0xDF. Thank you Sergiy Domin for reporting this bug. Features 0x59..0x5E (6 axis separation values). Report these values as normal continuous (C) values instead of just uninterpreted bytes. 0.9.3 26 November 2018 Display Detection Display detection no longer performs initial probes of I2C slave addresses on each possible /dev/i2c device. These initial probes do not return valid information on a Dell P2715Q, and have been seen to cause screen corruption on Dell XPS 13 laptops. In addition, /dev/i2c devices for Synopsys DesignWare are automatically skipped. Thank you Robert Munteanu for reporting and helping diagnose the P2715Q issues. Thank you Federico, developer of CLightd which uses the ddcutil API, jghauser, and especially Dr-Ongo for extensive help in reporting and diagnosing the Dell XPS 13 screen corruption. As a result of the changes to display detection, ddcutil detect --verbose no longer reports the presence of slave addresses x30 (EDID block number) or x37 (DDC), but does report whether a display is an Embedded Display Port (eDP) device, which is the case for recent laptop displays. It also reports the sysfs device name. User Supplied Feature Definitions ddcutil internals have been extensively restructured for future support of user supplied feature definitions. This will allow users to supply feature definitions for manufacturer reserved features, i.e. those in the range xe0..xff. While not yet ready for public use, there are a couple changes already visible in the user interface Command option Explanation --udef check for user supplied feature definitions --noudef do not check for user suplied feature definitions (currently the default) The following feature group has been added: Group name Explanation USER or UDF features having a user supplied feature definition Tracing Added trace groups: Name Purpose UDF user defined features DDCIO low level DDC functions VCP feature metadata Because of the volume of output, trace group \"DDC\" has been split into DDC and DDCIO, with the latter containing low level DDC services. API Changes The C API has had a few changes to support user supplied feature definitions and reflecting experience gained from work on the Qt C++ GUI interface. See API Changes in Release 9.3 for details. Miscellaneous Vebose output of the environment command now displays execution timestamps to aid in interpreting system logs. 0.9.2 01 September 2018 Command ddcutil detect Eliminate the Supports DDC: line. The output of this line reflects the result of a simple test for slave address x37 at the I2C layer. During display detection, ddcutil also attempts a real DDC exchange at the higher, DDC layer of code, and relies on this result to determine whether the monitor supports DDC. The simple x37 test is vestigial and has no effect on program logic. It also has been shown to be inadequate. It has been reported that the Dell P2715Q sometimes fails the simple x37 test even though it supports DDC. On the other hand the x37 test succeeds on a Dell U3011 when DDC is turned off in the OSD. Thank you Robert Muntreanu for the Dell P2715Q report. The result of the x37 test is still reported as part of the --verbose output of detect . Eliminate duplicate displays for DisplayPort connected monitors. Under some circumstances, a DisplayPort connected monitor is assigned two /dev/i2c devices, and detect would report two (identical) monitors. However, only one of the /dev/i2c devices supports DDC communication. This change addresses the problem for the nouveau driver, and only defines a ddcutil display for the good /dev/i2c device. Command ddcutil --help Include command scs (Save Current Settings) in the output of ddcutil --help . ddcutil scs executes a Save Current Settings operation, which is supported by some but not all DDC capable displays. This command was implemented some time ago, but was not described in the help output. Command ddcutil environment When checking for group i2c membership, issue a special message if running as root instead of the generic message that the current user is not a member of group i2c. USB connected displays Fix an invalid feature read of a USB connected display, observed when getting the controller manufacturer but VCP feature code xC8 is unsupported. When reading a USB report, regard errno EINVAL as an expected indication that no value is found rather than an unexpected status code. Tracing Fix the cause of a segfault when tracing a write-only DDC exchange (i.e. setting a VCP value) Disable debug messages regarding device id table initialization in the environment command. Eliminate double newlines in several error and trace messages Building ddcutil libusb function libusb_set_debug() is deprecated in recent libusb versions, in favor of libusb_set_option() , resulting in a compiler warning when flag -Wdeprecated-declarations is set. Calls to libusb_set_debug() in file libusb_util.c are replaced by iftested code that uses the proper function. Fix an unreachable assert() statement in file execution_stats.c that was detected by compiling with option -Werror-switch-unreachable. Thank you Jonathan Scruggs. Add \"__attribute__ ((deprecated))\" statements to functions ddca_report_active_displays() and ddca_get_feature_name_by_display() , in header file ddcutil_c_api.h . The inline documentation for these function already indicated their deprecated status. 0.9.1 27 May 2018 Bug Fix Fix the cause of an abort that may occur on command environment --verbose when examining an extremely large log file. 0.9.0 13 May 2018 Significant Command Line Changes Two enhancements will be of interest to general users: The setvcp command now allows new values for Continuous type features to be specified as relative values, e.g. the following commands increase or decrease the value of the brightness feature by 5. $ ddcutil setvcp 10 + 5 $ ddcutil setvcp 10 - 5 Note that parsing requires that \"+\" and \"-\" be surrounded by spaces. Option --no-table is now the default. Table type features are by default not included in most feature groups specified on getvcp , e.g. getvcp known . Features of type Table are rare. The DDC/CI spec does not provide a clean way for getvcp to determine that a table feature does not exist. As a result, getvcp typically has to exceed its retry count before giving up. (Exclusion of table features does not occur if a feature is explicitly specified by its hex code, or for feature groups TABLE or LUT .) The --no-table (formerly --notable ) and -show-table options explicitly control this behavior. Note that --no-table does not apply for subsets TABLE or LUT. For subsets SCAN and MANUFACTURER, the effect of --show-table / --no-table on manufacturer-specific feature codes (xe0..xff) is more complicated. ddcutil has no information about the feature characteristics of manufacturer-specific codes. Normally, it attempts only a non-table read. However, if both --verbose and --show-table are in effect, then a table read is attempted as well as a non-table read. Reporting Unsupported Features The interpretation of --show-unsupported has been tweaked. This option applies to command getvcp . (The probe command always reports unsupported features.) Command getvcp reports unsupported features if any of the following hold: - A specific feature was specified by its code, as opposed to a feature set. - Verbose output is in effect - Option --show-unsupported was specified. Option --show-unsupported is no longer automatically set for feature set ALL , which is now simply a synonym for KNOWN . Options --rw , --ro , --wo Options --rw and --ro apply to both the getvcp and vcpinfo commands. Option --wo applies only to vcpinfo . If specified, features shown are restricted to those that are read-write, read-only, or write-only. For example: $ ddcutil getvcp all --ro Option --mccs Filters the information returned by vcpinfo to that for the specified MCCS version. For example, $ ddcutil vcpinfo --mccs 2.1 Feature selection for ddcutil vcpinfo table is not properly version sensitive. -- take version from monitor selection if specified (VERIFY) -- option --mccs-version to force specific version Feature Set Identifiers Additional feature sets have been defined for the getvcp and vcpinfo commands. They surface internal ddcutil feature descriptions, and are intended to facilitate exploring the MCCS specification and its implementation on particular monitors. They will likely be of interest to only a few user. Feature Set Description SCONT Simple Continuous features CCONT Complex Continuous features CONT All Continuous features SNC NC features having a defined set of features for byte SL CNC NC features using multiple bytes NC_WO NC features that are Write NC_CONT Features of type NC that reserve specified values as flags, alloting the remaining values to a continuous range NC All Non-Continuous features MFG is now a valid synonym for feature set MANUFACTURER. Feature sets KNOWN and ALL are now synonyms. Miscellaneous The VCP file created by dumpvcp now includes a PRODUCT_CODE field including the manufacturer product code from the EDID. For some manufacturers, the model name in the EDID does not in fact distinguish among models. Notably, Samsung commonly uses just \"Syncmaster\" for the model name. Currently, loadvcp recognizes this field name but does not make use of the value. Building ddcutil Eliminate compiler flag -Wpedantic in Makefiles. This flag had been added to diagnose some obscure compiler warnings regarding system header files. It was flagging perfectly valid code as problematic, and caused build failures on Gentoo. Code changes to avoid -wformat-overflow , -wformat-truncation , and -wstringop-trunction warnings introduced with GCC 8, generally by making buffers larger. (All such warnings had flagged situations that never would result in buffer overflow.) API Changes The C API has been extensively revised reflecting experience gained from work on a Qt C++ GUI interface. See API Changes in Release 9.0 for details. Work on Python API has been suspended. Proof of concept implementations exist in the source tree for implementations using GObject API. SWIG, CFFI, and and Cython. However, these are incomplete and not intended for public use. 0.8.6 20 January 2018 The externally visible changes in this release include minor enhancements and bug fixes. There are also changes in the C API. Internally, there have been extensive changes in support of the C and (future) Python APIs. User Interface Changes Because of the design of the DDC/CI protocol, there is no certain way to distinguish a response indicating that a feature of type Table (T) is unsupported from a DDC/CI protocol error. As a result, ddcutil getvcp performs the maximum number of retries on a Table type feature before giving up. However, Table type features are rarely implemented. The new --notable option allows Table type features to be ignored, speeding up execution of getvcp commmands for multiple features. Option --notable applies if the argument to getvcp is a feature set, e.g. COLOR or KNOWN instead of a single feature id. In that case Table type features are ignored. C API changes Replace structs that use #iftests Structs DDCA_Single_Vcp_Value and DDCA_Non_Table_Value_Reponse used preprocessor #iftests for endian-ness to properly overlay the 2 byte continuous values (e.g. max value) on a pairs of 1 byte NC values (e.g. ml, mh). The use of #iftests proved incompatible with Python C function interface systems (e.g. Cython, CFFI). Struct DDCA_Single_Vcp_Value has been replaced by struct DDCA_Any_Vcp_Value . Function ddca_get_single_vcp_value() has been replaced by fuction ddca_get_any_vcp_value() , which uses DDCA_Any_Vcp_Value . Struct DDCA_Non_Table_Value_Response has been replaced by struct DDCA_Non_Table_Value . Function ddca_get_non_table_value() now returns a DDCA_Non_Table_Value , not a DDCA_Non_Table_Value_Response . DDCA_Any_Vcp_Value and DDCA_Non_Table_Value do not define 2 byte current and max values for Continuous (C) features. The 2 byte current and max values must be calculated from the appropriate pairs of single byte values, e.g. cur_val = sh << 8 | sl Eliminate use of longjmp The use of longjmp() to handle exceptional error condiitions (typically program logic errors) has been eliminated. API functions removed: ddca_register_jmp_buf() , ddca_get_global_failure_information() Structs removed: DDCA_Global_Failure_Information Miscellaneous Add trace class ENV for tracing environment related functions Internally, many functions in key portions of the code base now return exception-like structs instead of status codes. Option --excp causes ddcutil to report these exception-like structs when they are converted to status codes (and the internal detail is discarded). Bug Fixes Fix cause of a segfault in the environment command on Arch Linux due to the lack of the \"arch\" command in that distribution. Thank you Despruk. Fix a segfault when probing DRM using the environment command on aarch64. Fix a typo in the recommendations section at the end of the environment command. Thank you Mirek Svoboda 0.8.5 16 November 2017 This release contains a large number of minor enhancements and bug fixes. Most significant are those related to alternative environments, such as Raspberry Pi systems. Those running ddcutil on a 32 bit system, either i386 or Raspberry Pi, should upgrade to address a segfault in the environment command. Otherwise, there is no need to upgrade to this release unless you are experiencing problems. Changes to facilitate scripting Do not output a warning message regarding undetected VCP version if message level is --terse . \"Display not found\" message now directed to stderr instead of stdout. Packaging Changes to meet Debian distribution standards. Clean up debian/rules and other files in the debian directory. Add a changelog file, normally installed in file /usr/share/doc/ddcutil/Changelog. Rename NEWS file to NEWS.md Add configure option --enable-x11 / --disable-x11 . The default is --enable-x11 . If --disable-x11 is specified, ddcutil is built without X11 related code, which is used only for diagnostics within the environment command. Directory package has been removed from the ddcutil git tree and is no longer included in the tarball. This more cleanly separates \"downstream\" from \"upstream\" activities. Packagers for Linux distributions should contact if this creates problems. Command environment enhancements The environment command is extensively revised. The increasingly large collection of tests has been consolidated. In particular: Tests are now sensitive to machine architecture. Performs alternative tests on arm systems, inlcuding the Raspberry Pi. Added a consolidated collection of suggestions at the end that suggest ways for the user to address configuration issues. Fixed a bug that caused a segfault in 32 bit versions of ddcutil . Use of shell commands has largely been replaced with API calls, addressing some obscure shell errors. glib-2.0 The required glib-2.0 version has been increased from 2.16 to 2.32 reflecting the use of glib thread functions. Consequently, ddcutil no longer builds on some older Linux distributions. Bug fixes Fix a logic error in the VCP version comparison function vcp_version_le(). This bug affected only audio related VCP feature codes x8f, x91, and x93. It also affected experimental command watch which listens for monitor changes not made by ddcutil , i.e. by pressing buttons on the monitor. Properly handle the failure case where a display is detected on an I2C bus (EDID is read) but DDC communication fails, and the user specifies the display on the command line using the I2C bus number (option --bus ). Fix the cause of a segfault when the loadvcp command reads a user modified VCP file. The command now fails gracefully if none of MFG_ID, MODEL, and SN are present. Fix the cause of a segfault when displaying I2C functionality flags in the --environment command. This segfault was seen only in 32 bit versions of ddcutil . The --stats option showed incorrect time statistics on 32 bit versions of ddcutil . Add \"-lddcutil\" to output of \"pkgconfig ddcutil --libs\". Thank you Federico. Miscellaneous Improve reporting of the individual errors that result in command failure due to maximum I2C retries exceeded. interrogate , environment and usbenvironment now redirect all stderr output to stdout for easier capture Added command line options -trcfile and -trcfunc to enable tracing by file name and function name. Added configuration option --enable-x11 controlling whether X11 related diagnostics are included in the environment and interrogate commands, allowing ddcutil to build in embedded environments that lack X11. The default is yes . Verbose EDID decription, e.g. on command detect --verbose , now reports EDID byte 24 (x14), the supported features bitmap. This is purely informational. Ongoing work to make functions thread safe. Code cleanup. 0.8.4 22 July 2017 This release primarily contains packaging changes to meet Fedora distribution standards. It also includes minor improvements and bug fixes. There is no need to install it unless you are experiencing problems. Command ddcutil interrogate Do not include usbenvironment diagnostics as part of the interrogate command. USB connected monitors are rare and USB related diagnostics clutter the report. libddcutil-devel Do not package static libraries (.a and .la files) in libddcutil-devel. Bug fixes Prevent a segfault in monitor detection that occurrs when slave address x50 is detected on an I2C bus, but reading the EDID at that address fails. Address an assert failure in the ddcutil usbenvironment command due to an unexpected library return code. In the device identification cross reference report of ddcutil environment , properly handle I2C bus number -1, used internally to indicate unknown. 0.8.2 17 May 2017 This release introduces minor improvements to the diagnostic output of the environment , detect , and interrogate commands. There is no need to install it unless you are experiencing problems. Command ddcutil detect If a display appears to support DDC (I2C slave address x37 is active) but communication fails, perform a heuristic test as to whether it is a laptop display, issue message appropriately. Changes to reduce the number of feature reads performed when detecting monitors, slightly improving performance. Option --stats errors Maintain and report a secondary count of the individual errors that are rolled up into \"retry count exceeded\" errors. ddcutil environment --verbose changes Eliminate checks for package i2c-tools Report additional information about system hardware Add a cross reference report for the multiple ways that different subsystems identify a monitor and its I2C bus Consolidate some tests to reduce redundancy Check for DisplayPort Multi-Stream Technology (DPMST) devices Eliminate the cause of a bogus error message when scanning devices Packaging Changes to the requirements of package i2c-tools . Generally speaking, it is no longer needed for building ddcutil , and is optionally used as part of the diagnostic output of the environment command. Changed from Requires: to Suggests: for dpkg Requires: and BuildRequires: eliminated for rpm packaging in general BuildRequires: kept for SuSE rpm packaging. ddcutil needs file linux/i2c-dev.h, which is contained in package i2c-tools in SuSE releases through 13.2 Changes to packaging to conform to Debian standards Changes to packaging to conform to Fedora standards 0.8.1 06 May 2017 This is a bugfix release. There is no need to install it unless you are experiencing the segfault described below. Fixes a segfault that can occur after open() fails for a /dev/usb/hiddev device. 0.8.0 01 May 2017 Release 0.8.0 contains new features intended to address issues with particular monitors and user environments, to changes to improve performance, and code restructuring for future enhancements General Changes Monitor detection and cataloging has been extensively reworked. To support the library version of ddcutil used by the C (and future Python) APIs, the list of displays is determined at program/library initialization and saved. The processing of the DDC Null Response has changed. Normally a Null Response indicates a processing error in the monitor. Some monitors also use the Null Response to indicate that a VCP feature is unsupported. ddcutil now performs an extended sleep when receiving a Null Message response to allow the monitor to recover. It also performs an initial check of whether a monitor uses DDC Null Response to indicate unsupported features. See DDC Null Response . Linux error numbers no longer appear \"modulated\" in messages. That is, an EACCES error is reported as -13, not -1013. Note that the C API has always returned Linux error numbers in unmodulated form. General Options Option --async parallelizes the monitor checks executed during display detection. If there are multiple monitors, initial monitor checks are performed in multiple threads, improving performance. This may become the default in future releases. Option --nodetect is valid if the display is specified by its I2C bus number, using option --bus . In that case the initial detection of all displays is skipped, improving performance. This may become the default in future releases. Option --hiddev specifies a USB monitor connection by its hiddev device number. For example: --hiddev 3 refers to device /dev/usb/hiddev3. There is no single letter specifier for this option. Option --brief is now a synonym for --terse Added --stats class elapsed . --stats time is a synonym for --stats elapsed . Shows program elapsed time. Changes to Specific Commands: environment and interrogate commands: Report ddcutil version probe , interrogate , and getvcp scan commands: Do not include table features unless output level is VERBOSE. This speeds up execution as table reads for unsupported features execute the maximum number of retries. It also clarifies performance statistics. No monitors implementing table type features have yet been observed. interrogate command: Report performance statistics for individual parts of interrogate . getvcp command: If --terse output is specified, then the VCP data is output in a form that is easily machine readable. See getvcp command setvcp and loadvcp commands: By default, setvcp and loadvcp verify that a value has been successfully set by reading the value from the monitor after writing it. Option --noverify disables this check. Bug Fixes Fixed a segfault that occurred when a monitor returned a 0 length capabilities string. Variables holding nanoseconds have been changed from type long to uint64_t to address overflow problems on 32 bit systems such as Raspberry Pi. C API The C API has undergone extensive changes. Name Changes Names have been changed for consistency and clarity. Names of certain functions used in message generation have been shortened to simplify printf() type functions. Old typedef name New typedef name VCP_Feature_Code DDCA_Vcp_Feature_Code Version_Feature_Info DDCA_Version_Feature_Info Vcp_Value_Type DDCA_Vcp_Value_Type Single_Vcp_Value DDCA_Single_Vcp_Value Old function name New function name ddca_status_code_name() ddca_rc_name() ddca_status_code_desc() ddca_rc_desc() ddca_repr_display_identifier() ddca_did_repr() ddca_create_display_ref() ddca_get_display_ref() ddca_repr_display_ref() ddca_dref_repr() ddca_repr_display_handle() ddca_dh_repr() ddca_get_displays() ddca_get_display_info_list() ddca_repr_mccs_version() ddca_mccs_version_id_name() ddca_mccs_version_id_string() ddca_mccs_version_id_desc() Comments: - Function ddca_create_display_ref() was renamed to ddca_get_display_ref() to reflect the fact that it returns a DDCA_Display_Reference from the internal data structures representing detected displays. Struct Old field name New field name DDCA_Ddcutil_Version_Spec build micro Enum Old value name New value name DDCA_Output_Level OL_TERSE DDCA_OL_TERSE DDCA_Output_Level OL_NORMAL DDCA_OL_NORMAL DDCA_Output_Level OL_VERBOSE DDCA_OL_VERBOSE DDCA_IO_Mode DDC_IO_DEVI2C DDCA_IO_DEVI2C DDCA_IO_Mode DDC_IO_ADL DDCA_IO_ADL DDCA_IO_Mode USB_IO DDCA_IO_USB DDCA_Vcp_Value_Type NON_TABLE_VCP_VALUE DDCA_NON_TABLE_VCP_VALUE DDCA_Vcp_Value_Type TABLE_VCP_VALUE DDCA_TABLE_VCP_VALUE Structs and Functions Removed Structs removed Comment DDCA_IO_Location Use DCCA_IO_Path Functions removed Comment ddca_built_with_adl() Use ddca_get_build_options() ddca_built_with_usb() Use ddca_get_built_options() Enums, Structs, and Functions Added or Changed New enum Purpose DDCA_Stats_Type Used as both values and bitflags for statistics types New Structs Purpose DDCA_Adlno Represents a ADL adapter number/display number pair DDCA_IO_PATH Physical path for MCCS communication Comments: Struct DDCA_Display_Location is replaced by DDCA_IO_Path , which contains only the io mode and device identifiers for that mode. USB bus and device numbers were removed because they are attributes by which the physical path (hiddev device) can be found, not the path itself. Struct DDCA_Display_Info has been adjusted to use DDCA_IO_Path . Function added Purpose ddca_ddcutil_version() gets version as a struct of numbers ddca_reset_stats() reset performance statistics ddca_show_stats() report performance statistics ddca_enable_verify() controls whether VCP values are read after being set ddca_is_verify_enabled() queries whether VCP values are verified ddca_free_display_info_list() free function for struct ddca_create_usb_hiddev_display_identifier() create identifier for hiddev number ddca_get_simple_nc_feature_value_name() lookup name of simple NC feature value Other Changes Functions now return Linux error number -EINVAL rather than DDC specific error number DDCL_ARG in case of invalid argument The display selection lifecycle has been changed. The DDCA_Display_Identifier is not the only way to obtain a DDCA_Display_Reference . It can be found in one of 2 ways: Function ddca_get_display_info_list() returns a collection DDCA_Display_Info , containing display identification information (e.g. ddcutil assigned display number, I2c Bus number, manufacturer id, etc.) and a display reference. The client program can search through the returned collection to find the desired monitor. A DDCA_Display_Identifier can be created and passed to ddca_get_display_ref(), which returns a DDCA_Display_Reference . See sample program demo_display_selection.c for examples. Sample code files: The following example files for using the C API have been added: File name Purpose demo_global_settings.c Report and modify global settings demo_display_selection.c Display selection demo_vcpinfo.c Query VCP feature code descriptons demo_get_set_vcp.c Get and set VCP values File clmain.c is now a miscellaneous catchall, mainly for testing. Build system changes src/Makefile.am: change dist-hook to use -prune option per Knut Omang; avoids eror in case there is nothing to erase (i.e. build hasn't happened) Added cmake file FindDDCUtil.cmake from Dorian Vogel 0.7.3 05 March 2017 Maintenance release. Add additional diagnostic tests to command ddcutil environment --verbose *. New configure option --enable-drm . If enabled (the default), command ddcutil environment --verbose includes additional tests that use DRM services to better analyze disrepancies observed in the field between the EDID read directly from the monitor and that reported by X11. Option --enable-drm requires that a recent version (>= 2.4.67) of the development package for libdrm2 (libdrm-dev or libdrm-devel depending on Linux distribution) be installed when building ddcutil . If a sufficently recent version is not detected, configure issues a warning and reverts to --disable-drm . If minimizing executable size is important, set --disable-drm , as DRM services are used only for diagnostics. Additional information on ddcutil detect --verbose . Report and interpret USB vendor id/product id when detect cannot open a hiddev device. This is usually benign, and identifying the device should make this evident. Suggest that the user check that DDC/CI is enabled in the monitor's on screen display if I2C bus x37 (DDC) is responsive, but DDC communication fails. 0.7.2 01 February 2017 Maintenance release. Fixes a critical bug in release 0.7.1 where insufficient privileges on a /dev/i2c-n device causes program termination. ddcutil interrogate always executes with --set-slave-address in effect Minor improvements to ddcutil environment and ddcutil interrogate output Minor improvements to ddcutil detect --verbose Add explanations for additional errno values 0.7.1 27 January 2017 Mantenance release. Add option --force-slave-address which causes ddcutil to take control of slave addresses on the I2C bus even if they are in use. Internally, ioctl(I2C_FORCE_SLAVE) is called instead of ioctl(I2C_SLAVE) . This is intended as a possible workaround for situations where monitors on an I2C bus are not detected. See Option --force-slave-address Option --force disables various checking. It's use is likely to result in command failure, but may provide useful information as to the source of problems. See Option --force Fix the cause of a segfault when displaying statistics for option --stats errors or simply --stats , or on the interrogate command. make install will not install C header files unless configuration option --enable-lib is set. Fix the cause of a Makefile error when trying to strip dependency information from libddctuil.la during make install . Extensive rework of Autotools files for future support of Python 3 as well as Python 2. This work is incomplete. Emit diagnostic messages to aid in debugging certain situations seen only in the field. 0.7.0 03 January 2017 C API Should be fairly stable, though not all features of ddcutil are exposed. Reflecting the presence of APIs, the default for the --enable-lib configuration option is now \"yes\". The following shared object library is created: libddcutil.so Additional prebuilt packages: libddcutil0, libddcutil-dev (Debian, Ubuntu) or ddcutil-devel (Fedora, SUSE) Python API The Python API, implemented using SWIG, is a rough proof of concept and subject to major change. SWIG support is only available by building from source, not from pre-built packages. Requires --enable-swig configuration option. A new command line option --mfg , which allows for monitor selection using the 3 character manufacturer id found in the EDID. --model and -sn no longer need to specified together. If any of --mfg , -model , and -sn are specified, the first monitor to match all of the manufacturer/model/serial-numbers that are specified is chosen. The monitor feature and capabilities portion of interrogate has been enhanced. This functionality is also exposed using the new probe command which operates on a single monitor. Parsing of the capabilities string is enhanced to accomodate monitors that do not separate feature codes by blanks. 0.6.1 21 November 2016 Maintenance release. Improve recovery and diagnotistic messages for certain exceptional conditions. Command ddcutil interrogate now reports the differences between VCP codes declared in the capabilities string and those observed by scanning. Extensive internal changes in preparation for future C and Python APIs. 0.6.0 01 October 2016 Rename project from ddctool to ddcutil. Primary executable is now named ddcutil Shared library is now named libddcutil.so Tarball is now named ddcutil.n.n.n.tar.gz 0.5.3 24 September 2016 Fix overzealous code cleanup in release 0.5.1. Undefined reference to function is_module_loaded_using_sysfs() when building without ADL support. Error in command parsing. Command arguments were ignored. 0.5.1 23 September 2016 Minor improvements to diagnostics of the environment and interrogate commands: Check if i2c_dev is built into the kernel as an alternative to it being a loadable kernel module Recognize amdgpu video driver 0.5 09 September 2016 This is the first formal release of ddcutil Rework USB monitor support based on testing with Eizo Coloredge and NEC PA series -- Probing of USB connected monitors is greatly extended and refactored from ddcutil environment into a separate command ddcutil usbenv . Libraries hidraw and libusb are used as well as hiddev. HID Report Descriptors are parsed. This probing is included in ddcutil interrogate . -- configure option --enable-usb/--disable-usb controls whether ddcutil is built with USB monitor support. The default is --enable-usb . When building with USB support, packages for udev, hidraw, hiddev, and libusb are required. Simplify README.md. Refer to www.ddcutil.com for most documentation The assumption that I2C buses are numbered consecutively is removed. Required for Raspberry Pi. Allow a display to be specified on the command ddcutil loadvcp . This addresses the situation where a monitor presents both an I2C and a USB interface. Normally, the display is determined using the data stored in the VCP file, and the I2C display interface is chosen over the USB interface. If a display is specified, then the model and sn from its EDID must match those in the VCP data being loaded. Add ddcutil command option --timestamp/--ts . If specified, trace messages are prefaced with an elapsed timestamp. Because of changing package requirements, ddcutil no longer builds in the openSUSE Build Service (OBS) for older OS versions (openSUSE 13.1, Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04). ddcutil currently does not build for any openSUSE version in the openSUSE Build Service due to violation of policy guidelines. This problem will be addressed in a subsequent release. openSUSE users can build ddcutil from its tarball.","title":"Release Notes"},{"location":"release_notes/#release-notes","text":"For ddcui release notes, see ddcui Release Notes .","title":"Release Notes"},{"location":"release_notes/#121-rc1","text":"24 November 2021 These are preliminary notes for upcoming release 1.2.1.","title":"1.2.1-rc1"},{"location":"release_notes/#option-settings","text":"Until now, details of the current configuration and option settings have been shown at the start of any command when --verbose is in effect.

Most commonly, this is seen with displays connected to docking stations. For several years now, all docking station connected displays, even those using HDMI or DVI connections, internally rely on a DisplayPort MST connection between the computer and the docking station. The kernel changes were made in the Direct Rendering Mode (DRM) subsytem. The Intel i915 and AMD amdgpu drivers, which are implemented as part of DRM, have been tested and (mostly) work. Other drivers part of the kernel DRM component, e.g. nouveau, should also work but have not been tested. Nvidia's proprietary driver uses it own proprietary DRM implementation and still does not support DDC communication over MST. Unfortunately there are problems with the DRM code, which ddcutil can only sometimes work around. Sometimes the display's EDID cannot be read on I2C slave address x50. As a result, ddcutil does not report the existence of a display connected to the /dev/i2c device. ddcutil attempts to work around this by trying to read the EDID multiple times with both 128 and 256 block sizes. Depending on the monitor, usually one or the other will work, but sometimes neither do. Option --edid-read-size , which was introduced in release 1.0.1, can force the block size to 128 or 256. This problem can be unrecoverable when the computer suspends and resumes, requiring reboot. On the other hand, the same monitor may appear as two different /dev/i2c devices, only one of which supports DDC. Curiously EDID read failures are associated with the /dev/i2c device that supports DDC. ddcutil attempts to detect which /dev/i2c device should be used for monitor communication, and the detect command reports the other as a \"Phantom Display\" instead of an \"Invalid Display\".

Option: --lazy-sleep Causes some sleep events required by the DDC/CI protocol to occur in deferred mode. Instead of immediately sleeping after DDC IO events that require an interval before the next request is made of the display, the required sleep time is added to the current realtime value and saved in the associated display reference. Before the next DDC IO message to the display, the value in the display reference is checked, and if greater than the now current real time, a sleep for the remaining time occurs. Unfortunately, this option appears to have only a neglible effect on execution time. Execution statistics show an approximately 1 ms reduction in sleep time, e.g. 50 to 49 miliiseconds. This negligable effect reinforces the fact that most of ddcutil 's elapsed time is spent in DDC mandated delays and waiting for DDC IO to complete.

Certain LG Ultrawide monitors contain neither an ASCII nor binary serial number in their EDID. Consequently, all monitors of the same model have the same EDID.

Allow a display to be specified on the command ddcutil loadvcp . This addresses the situation where a monitor presents both an I2C and a USB interface. Normally, the display is determined using the data stored in the VCP file, and the I2C display interface is chosen over the USB interface.

A common use of this facility is to replace the list of valid values of a simple non-continuous feature. User Defined Features is enabled or disabled using command line options --udf or --noudef . The default is --udf . The user defined features for a monitor are specified in a feature definition file. The format of this file is subject to change. User Defined Feature File Here's an example of a file that specifies user defined features. $ cat ~/.local/share/ddcutil/DEL-DELL_U2222-16485.mccs MFG_ID DEL MODEL DELL U2222 PRODUCT_CODE 16485 MCCS_VERSION 2.2 FEATURE_CODE FD Feature Name ATTRS NC RW VALUE 0 First Val VALUE 0X01 Second Val 0x VALUE X02 Third value X VALUE 03H H at end FEATURE_CODE xFB Another Feature ATTRS C RO FEATURE_CODE 0xfa a feature with code staring with 0x ATTRS C RO The first 3 lines identify the monitor model, using a 3 character manufacturer id, the model name, and the product number, as given in the EDID. The feature definition applies to any monitor that matches those identifiers. Model name and product number are both required because some manufacturers use generic model names, and many set the product number to 0. For example, Samsung commonly uses the name \"SyncMaster\", and LG commonly uses the name \"LG ULTRAWIDE\". These three fields are also are used to create the file name of the feature description, which has the form <mfg_id>-<model name>-<product code>.mccs . The values in the file name must match those in the file. The optional MCCS_VERSION line specifies the version of the MCCS Specification used to describe the monitor. If specified, it is used instead of the value returned by querying VCP feature xDF (VCP Version). If the MCCS version is also specified using the --mccs command line option, the command line option takes precedence. In addition to the monitor identification lines and optional MCCS version line, there are one or more feature definitions. Each defnition starts with a line of the form FEATURE_CODE <feature-id> <feature name> . Feature codes are implicitly hex numbers, and can be written with or without a leading \"x\". The ATTRS line contains feature attributes: \"C\" or \"NC\" indicating whether the feature is continuous or non-continuous, and \"RW\", \"RO\", or \"WO\" indicating whether the feature is read-write, read-only, or write-only. For non-continuous features, there are one or more VALUE lines describing the possible values. Each line has the form: VALUE <value> <description> . Feature values can be written either as decimal or hexadecimal. The MCCS specification has evolved to include features that don't neatly conform the original Continuous/Non-Continuous classification. For example, continous features can have special reserved values, and non-continuous features exist that do not have simple tables of feature values, but instead have unique interpretations.

The feature definition applies to any monitor that matches those identifiers. Model name and product number are both required because some manufacturers use generic model names, and many set the product number to 0. For example, Samsung commonly uses the name \"SyncMaster\", and LG commonly uses the name \"LG ULTRAWIDE\". These three fields are also are used to create the file name of the feature description, which has the form <mfg_id>-<model name>-<product code>.mccs . The values in the file name must match those in the file. The optional MCCS_VERSION line specifies the version of the MCCS Specification used to describe the monitor. If specified, it is used instead of the value returned by querying VCP feature xDF (VCP Version). If the MCCS version is also specified using the --mccs command line option, the command line option takes precedence. In addition to the monitor identification lines and optional MCCS version line, there are one or more feature definitions. Each defnition starts with a line of the form FEATURE_CODE <feature-id> <feature name> . Feature codes are implicitly hex numbers, and can be written with or without a leading \"x\". The ATTRS line contains feature attributes: \"C\" or \"NC\" indicating whether the feature is continuous or non-continuous, and \"RW\", \"RO\", or \"WO\" indicating whether the feature is read-write, read-only, or write-only. For non-continuous features, there are one or more VALUE lines describing the possible values. Each line has the form: VALUE <value> <description> . Feature values can be written either as decimal or hexadecimal. The MCCS specification has evolved to include features that don't neatly conform the original Continuous/Non-Continuous classification. For example, continous features can have special reserved values, and non-continuous features exist that do not have simple tables of feature values, but instead have unique interpretations.
